         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:10733:3"/> could) haue rudely delineated. The finiſhing of which worke in all the parts thereof was when I firſt vndertooke it, in regard of my weakeneſſe and other imployments in the worke of my miniſterie, ſo farre in my conceipt aboue my hopes, that I durſt ſcarce aſpire vnto it in my higheſt deſires, though in this kinde ambitious aboue my ſtrength. And yet now the Lord who taketh delight to manifeſt his power in the weakeneſſe of his inſtruments, hath enabled me to finiſh the laſt part of this worke. And as in the other parts to deſcribe the Warfare betweene the Chriſtian and his forraigne enemies, the Diuell and the World, with the meanes whereby hee may bee inabled to ouercome; ſo in this, the inteſtine warre that is in our ſelues betweene the Spirit &amp; the Fleſh: wherin if we will get the victorie we muſt after a ſort flee and abandon our ſelues, and if wee will kill our enemies, wee muſt mortifie and crucifie our earthly members. The which my poore labours I humbly offer to your Honours patronage, not becauſe I thinke them worthy your learned view, or ſo perfect that they may merit approbation in your iudicious cenſure, but that paſſing as tolerable in your eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, they may appeare euen commendable to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker iudgements, and (like meane ſeruants of Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Lords) may be more eſteemed and better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, when as they come abroad graced with your name.

                  <hi>our ſelues from all filthineſſe of the fleſh, and of the ſpirit;</hi> that is body and ſoule; and the Pſalmiſt ſaith, that the enemies <note place="margin">Pſal. 79. 2.</note> of the Church had cruelly giuen the <hi>fleſh of Gods Saints to the beaſts of the earth,</hi> that is the dead bodies of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, which alſo as he ſaith in the ſame place, were giuen to be meate to the fowles of the heauen.

In which reſpects, though the ſpirit of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his eſſence be alike preſent to all creatures, yet is he not ſaide to be giuen vnto them, or to be their ſpirit, becauſe they haue no right vnto him by couenant as we haue, nor any intereſt by Ieſus Chriſt, neither yet any efficacy, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration nor influence of ſauing grace from him, in all which he is proper onely to the Elect. Moreouer by vertue of this donation and right, the holy ſpirit becomming ours, doeth worke in vs after a ſpeciall and powerfull manner, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, familiar and in neare acquaintance with vs, like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates or coinhabitants, comforting, directing, ruling, ſtrengthening, and cheriſhing vs. In which reſpect we are ſaide to be his (<note n="a" place="margin">Cor. 3. 16. &amp; 6. 19. 2.

Whereas contrariwiſe worldlings and infidels, to all theſe purpoſes are meere ſtrangers vnto him, becauſe they receiue him not, but make their bodies habitations for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſpirits. For ſo our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>that the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receiue this ſpirit of trueth becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him, but yee</hi> (ſaith he to his Diſciples, and in them to all the faithfull) <hi>knowe him, for he dwelleth with you, and</hi>

Finally, to conclude this point, although the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit dwelleth in vs, in reſpect of eſſence as in other creatures; yet he doth after an eſpeciall manner exerciſe his nature and ſhewe his preſence by his vertue and efficacie more in the faithfull then in the whole earth, in that he chooſeth them for his owne peculiar people, taketh full poſſeſsion of them as of his owne right, raigneth and ruleth in their hearts and conſciences, as in the chiefe ſeate of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, vniteth them vnto Chriſt their head, purgeth and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth them from their ſinne and corruption, repleniſheth them with all ſanctifying and ſauing grace, defendeth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth, and ſtrengtheneth them from all enemies, and from the inundation of all daungers by his almightie power and eſpeciall prouidence watching ouer them. And finally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth them in all trueth, and guideth and directeth them in the way of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to Gods kingdome. And euen thus doth Sathan dwell in the children of vnbeliefe; not by communicating his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence vnto them, for then they ſhould be no more men but incarnate diuels, but by taking full poſſeſsion of them as his owne vaſſels, by infuſing malice into their hearts, and all maner of corruption and ſinne into all the powers of their ſoules and bodies, by ſetting vp his throne in them, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them with his power according to his owne pleaſure, <note place="margin">2.

Thus alſo <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> although in many places he ſpeaketh as much for vs <note place="margin">De paeniten. lib 4. ca. 6.

And although hee granteth that the Apoſtle heere vſeth a borrowed ſpeech from thoſe who according to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtome fought for a maiſtery; and ſaith, that he did euill intreate and keepe vnder his body, like thoſe cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions who either with their ſiſtes, or with bags of ſand did beate and bruiſe their aduerſarie till they were blacke and blewe, yet he ſaith (and onely ſaith it without any ſhewe of reaſon) that it is very probable that <hi>Paul</hi> vſed to whip his owne body, both becauſe the Greeke word ſignifieth ſo much (which is vtterly falſe) and becauſe this kind of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was vſuall among the ancients; which alſo wee muſt take vpon his word, ſeeing he neither alleadgeth, nor in trueth is able to alleadge any authoritie for it. His other arguments to commend whipping and afflicting of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, are the Publicans ſmiting of his breaſt, whereby hee ſhewed the compunction of his heart in his humiliation and penitent confeſsion of his ſinnes; ſome teſtimonies of <hi>Hierome</hi> which ſpeake of faſting, ſackcloath and beating of the breaſt; Gods approouing and commaunding the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of voluntary vowes, the which he childiſhly reſtraineth <note place="margin">Numb. 30.</note> to faſtings and other afflictions of the body, and among the

And finally he produceth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt whoſe garment was Cammels hayre, his meate locuſts, his bed (as he ſaith, but proueth not) the ground, his houſe the deſart. All which reaſons and examples being farre vnfitting the wit of ſuch a ſubtill ſophiſter, and in trueth nothing to the purpoſe, I will paſſe ouer, ſuppoſing that the bare repeating of them is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent confutation, and that like abortiue birthes they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently dye, as ſoone as they come to light.</p>

To wit, ſuch things and wordes as might ouercome with violence even God himſelfe, and ſuch faſhions and endeauours, as would ſpeedily encline him to ſhewe mercy. For (ſaith he) I ſawe ſome of the penitents ſtand abroad in the open ayre, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there whole nights, vntill the morning, neuer mouing their feete out of the ſame place; and when they were grieuouſly vexed with drowſineſſe comming vpon them, they offered force to nature, and would not take any reſt, but reuiled themſelues, and with diſgraces and contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies offered againſt their owne perſons, they rowſed vp their ſpirits.

In others I ſawe

But what was the qualitie of their place and habitation? Surely it was very darke, vnhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, ſtinking, foule and filthy, ſo as it might fitly be called a priſon for condemned perſons, and the very ſight thereof might well be a miſtreſſe of perfect paenitence and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

Secondly, their pride appeareth in the acting and ſuffering of this voluntary penance in reſpect of the ende, which is not ſo much to mortifie the fleſh, as to make ſatisfaction to Gods iuſtice for their ſinnes, or to merrit his fauour and the ioyes of heauen; wherein as they derogate much from Gods mercy, and the all ſufficient merits &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Ieſus Chriſt, ſo alſo they manifeſt their helliſh pride, which will not ſuffer them wholly to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and aſcribe the glory of their iuſtification and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely to Gods free grace and Chriſts ſufferings and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: but needs will they ſhare with them in the praiſe, in part at leaſt pay their owne debt, and giue ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the purchaſe of our heauenly inheritance; In which

And thus <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> expoundeth this place. <hi>What then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall we deſtroy our owne bodies, and ſo goe out of the fleſh that wee may pleaſe God? Doeſt thou command vs to bee murtherers, when as thou pretendeſt to draw vs vnto vertue? Ye ſee what abſurdities doe hence ariſe, if theſe things be ſimply and literally vnderſtood. But by fleſh here he meaneth not the body or bodily eſſence, but a worldly and carnall life addicted to wantonneſſe and voluptuous pleaſures, which make the whole man to become fleſh. For as they who are led by Gods ſpirit, haue alſo their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies made ſpirituall, ſo they who are led by the fleſh and are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to carnall delights, they make their ſoules to become fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and carnall, not by changing the eſſence and ſubstance, but by ſpoiling it of true nobilitie. And this manner of ſpeaking is vſed in the Old Teſtament, where the fleſh ſignifieth that groſſe and earthy life, which is filthily intangled in all abſurd pleaſures. For God ſaith to</hi> Noah, <hi>my ſpirit ſhall not ſtay with theſe men becauſe they are fleſh. And yet</hi> Noah <hi>himſelfe was clothed and encompaſſed with the garment of fleſh; but this was not the fault that offended God, to be compaſſed with fleſh, becauſe this was the worke of nature, but in that they had made choiſe of a carnall and ſenſuall life.</hi> And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>They who are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God;</hi> and alſo addeth; <hi>But you are not in the fleſh but in the ſpirit, not vnderſtanding ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the ſubſtance of the fleſh, (for ſo they were in it to whom hee writeth) but ſuch a fleſh which is drawne and oppreſſed with luſts and paſsions.

Now let vs alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the teſtimony of the aduerſaries themſelues, who how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer in their doctrine they commonly confound the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and the fleſh as being all one; and in their whole pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of mortification, doe bend all their ſtrength againſt the bodie to ſubdue and keepe it vnder, yea euen to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſume and deſtroy it, as though it were their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enemy; yet hauing ſometime their eyes dazeled with the light of truth, they acknowledge euen the ſame veritie of doctrine which we teach and defend againſt them. Thus <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> their great ſchoole Doctor, extendeth the fleſh and corruption of nature to the whole man, the ſoule as well as the body, for writing on the wordes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <note place="margin">Aquin. in Rom. 7. lect. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>In me that is my fleſh, dwelleth no good thing,</hi> he ſaith, that <hi>in man as he is a ſinner dwelleth no good thing,</hi> neither in his body nor minde. Now this is ſpoken by the Apoſtle of himſelfe, and that as he was in the ſtate of grace and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as <hi>Aquinas</hi> a little before acknowledgeth and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt neceſſarily be referred to the part vnregenerate both ſoule and body. And commenting on theſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, hee ſaith, that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Aquin. in gal. 5. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>here is a doubt to be cleared;</hi> namely that, <hi>ſeeing to luſt or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet, is an act proper to the ſoule; therefore as it may ſeeme it cannot agree with the fleſh: vnto which we are to ſay with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:10733:42"/> 
                  <hi>that the fleſh is ſaide to couet or luſt, in regard that the ſoule doth luſt or deſire according to the fleſh; as the eye is ſaid to ſee, when as rather the ſoule ſeeth by the eye. And therefore the ſoule then luſteth by the fleſh, when as it deſireth thoſe things which are pleaſant according to the fleſh. But the ſoule luſteth or deſireth by it ſelfe, when as it is delighted in thoſe things which are according to the ſpirit, as workes of vertue and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine contemplation. Yea but if the fleſh luſteth by the ſpirit, how is it ſaide that it luſteth againſt it? namely in this reſpect, as the concupiſcence of the fleſh, hindereth the concupiſcence of the ſpirit.</hi> But this anſwere is not ſufficient, for if both kinds of concupiſcence come from the ſoule, the one immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the other mediately according to the fleſh, this maketh no contrarietie betweene the ſpirit and the fleſh, as he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it, but onely in the ſame acte of concupiſcence which is in the ſoule alone in reſpect of the diuers maner of luſting, the one kinde by the body, the other by it ſelfe. And therefore this anſwere would better fitte the obiection and agree with <hi>Auſtines</hi> ſpeech, that there is in the ſoule a double concupiſcence, the one in the part regenerate which is ſpirituall, the other in the part vnregenerate which is carnall, the which are directly contrary the one to the other. And thus he might anſwere another obiection which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe maketh againſt his owne wordes; for whereas the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, that <hi>the ſpirit luſteth againſt the fleſh,</hi> hee obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, that if we here take the ſpirit for the holy ſpirit, and grant that ſpirituall concupiſcence is onely againſt that which is euill, it will follow, that the fleſh or body againſt which the ſpirit luſteth is euill, which was the errour of the <hi>Manachees.</hi> To which he anſwereth that the ſpirit luſteth not againſt the nature of the fleſh, but againſt it deſires one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they extend to ſuperfluitie. But this anſwere croſſeth his former ſpeech, whereby he affirmed that the fleſh or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had no concupiſcence at all, but that it was an acte pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the ſoule alone. And therefore the obiection were better ſatisfied if we ſay that there is not onely in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate part of the ſoule, the concupiſcence of the ſpirit, but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10733:42"/> alſo the reliques of carnall concupiſcence in the part vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, which fight as contraries and enemies the one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other. But as <hi>Aquinas</hi> affirmeth, that concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence <note place="margin">Aquin. in Ro. 7. lect. 3. Lect. 4.</note> is onely an acte of the ſoule, and conſequently euill and carnall concupiſcence, as well as holy and ſpirituall, wherein he agreeth with vs; ſo alſo bee granteth in ſome places that the fleſh is the corruption of nature or originall ſinne, which is deriued vnto vs from our firſt parents. So he ſaith, that the <hi>carnalitie which importeth or ſignifieth the rebellion of the fleſh againſt the ſpirit, proceeded from the ſinne of our firſt parents, becauſe it belongeth to that fuell of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deriued from that ſinne.</hi> So hee expoundeth the <hi>lawe of the members to be that fuell and of ſinne and corruption which moueth vs to ſinne, and is the puniſhment of the ſinne of our firſt parents in vs who are their poſteritie.</hi> And yet more plainly <note place="margin">Aquin. in Rom. 8. lect. 2.</note> ſpeaking of thoſe words of the Apoſtle. <hi>But you are not in the fleſh, he ſaith that it is euident that this is not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the ſubſtance of the fleſh, ſeeing the Romanes were mortall men cloathed therewith, but he taketh the fleſh for the vices and corruptions of the fleſhe, according to that,</hi> 1.

And firſt they reaſon that this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemie of our ſaluation is the body and inferiour faculties of the ſoule, ſeeing it is vſually called by the name of fleſh and carnall concupiſcence. To which I anſwere that this manner of ſpeech is not proper but tropicall and figuratiue, and to bee vnderſtood by a metonymie of the ſubiect for the adiunct or qualitie, fleſh for the fleſhly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of corruption which hath defiled ſoule and body, the which is vſuall with the Hebrewes who in their ordinarie phraſe, put the abſtract for the concrete, and the ſubiect for the qualitie that belongeth vnto it; the which alſo the Greekes and Latines doe ſometimes imitate, as when they called a wicked fellow <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

I anſwere that it is thus called to ſhew how deepely our nature is tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and infected with the poiſon of ſinne, in that it is, (as it
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10733:44"/> were) incorporated into our fleſh, and one of our eſſentiall parts turned and (as it were) transformed into corruption, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to intimate vnto vs the dangerouſneſſe of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, in that it is not onely domeſticall, dwelling in vs, but (after a ſort) eſſentiall and inherent, ſo as it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to auoyde it, but we muſt deny our ſelues, nor to kill it, vnleſſe we crucifie our owne fleſh, nor to vanquiſh and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due it, vnleſſe we ouercome our ſelues. Yea but why is this corruption of nature called carnall and fleſhly, rather then animall and ſpirituall, if it were not ſeated in the bodie, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then in the ſoule? I anſwere that this corruption ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing defiled both the ſpeciall partes of man the body, as well as the ſoule, it was indifferent by a ſynecdoche to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the whole corruption of nature, by the name of either part. But if this anſwere will not ſatiſfie: but that they will further obiect; that the ſoule is the principall part and therefore the name or denomination ſhould follow it eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be cheifly taynted and corrupted, and the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>author of all ſinne: I anſwere that notwithſtanding all this, our enemie in this ſpirituall conflict is called the fleſh rather then the ſoule or ſpirit, to note vnto vs the greate contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and vnreconciliable emnity that are betweene the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants in this warfare; for as oppoſite are theſe the one to the other as light and darkenes, heauen and hell, God and the Diuell, good and euill. And therefore to expreſſe this contrarietie which is betweene them, names were choſen which were moſt extreamely oppoſite: and it is not called after the ſoule, becauſe there is ſome agreement betweene the ſoule and the body, and ſome reſemblance betweene the ſpirit and the ſoule, but after the body, which beeing the groſeſt and moſt earthy part of man is moſt oppoſite and <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 23.</note> different to the ſpirit which is the pureſt part of the minde and reaſon. </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">§ Sect. 2 The reaſons why the corruption of nature is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fleſh.</note> And vnto theſe diuers other reaſons may be added. For firſt this corruption of nature is called the fleſh, becauſe the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10733:44"/> body is the inſtrument of the ſoule to execute and put in practiſe the luſts and deſires of ſinfull concupiſcence, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Neither yeeld ye your members as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of vnrighteouſneſſe vnto ſinne.</hi> And the ſoule luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 13</note> by the body; whereof it is, that the ſinne of euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence is attributed to the body as the inſtrument, though the minde be the chiefe egent, euen as the eye is ſaid to ſee, when as the ſoule rather ſeeth by the eye, and the ſword is ſaid to kill, when as it is the man rather that killeth with the ſword. Secondly, becauſe the ſinfull corruption of our natures doth diſcouer and manifeſt it ſelfe rather by the outward actions of the body and concupiſcence of the fleſh, then by the ſecret cogitations and deſires of the minde and will. For whileſt this poiſon lurketh in the minde and will, it is ſecret and hidden alwaies to others, and oftentimes euen to our ſelues; but then it commeth to be known, when as it ſwelleth in our carnall concupiſcence, and breaketh out in the ſores of wicked actions. And as it fareth in the naturall birth, ſo in this helliſh broode of ſinne, after that the Diuell or our corrupt fleſh, haue caſt into the minde the curſed ſeede of ſin, the concupiſcence warmeth, faſhioneth and nouriſheth it, and ſo though in the firſt conception it was vnknowne euen to the parents themſelues that bred it, in the further growth thereof by luſt, and in the birth by the outward action, it is made manifeſt, both to them and others. Whereof it is that the holy Ghoſt calleth this ſin and corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>concupiſcence of the fleſh,</hi> not becauſe it gaue vnto it the firſt beeing in nature, but did onely firſt diſcouer it, and as it were brought it forth into the world. Thirdly, becauſe the baites and allurements wherewith the Diuell and the world intice vs to ſinne, are offered moſt vſually vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our mindes and vnderſtandings by the mediation of the bodie and the outward ſenſes, as riches, honours, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous pleaſures; for theſe obiects beeing tendred to the ſenſes, they preſent them to the vnderſtanding &amp; wil, which approue and chuſe them, not caring to ſwallow the hook of ſinne, ſo they may feed on the bewitching bait. But what is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10733:45"/> the cauſe hereof? Not for that the ſenſes and carnall concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence doe firſt infect the ſuperiour faculties, but becauſe being already corrupted they are ready to entertaine al ſuch wicked motions. And as inferiour ſeruants, doe not, nor dare not, perſwade their ſoueraignes to ſuch ſinfull actions as are contrarie to their liking and odious vnto them, as thoſe who are royally munificent and bountifull to baſe bribing and vnconſcionable pilling of their people, thoſe who ate chaſte and temperate to wantonneſſe and exceſſe; but onely vnto ſuch vices as they are by nature ſomewhat inclinable vnto: ſo is it in this little kingdome and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of man; for the vnderſtanding and reaſon are firſt corrupted and fallen from that integritie, ſpirituall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and excellencie in which they were created, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were inlightned with the knowledge of God and of ſpirituall and heauenly things in which originally they tooke all their delight and ſweet contentment, and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blinded with ignorance, and not able to diſcerne or rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh theſe diuine delicates, they ceaſe to liue this ſpirituall life and can take no pleaſure in heauenly things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giue themſelues ouer to all ſenſuality, and willingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine all corrupt motions of the fleſh, which by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the body and carnall appetite may conueigh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them any earthly delight. And thus the ſoule is ſaid to luſt by the fleſh, when as it deſireth thoſe things which are delightfull and pleaſant according to the fleſh; euen as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe the concupiſcence of the ſoule, in it created puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <note place="margin">Quid eſt ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carnem am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Fiftly the corruption of nature, as well in the ſoule as the bodie, is called fleſh, becauſe by the fleſh and carnall ſeede in our generation ſinne is propagated vnto the whole man, ſoule and body. And finally becauſe the ſoule, reaſon and vnderſtanding, forgetting their created excellencie, ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie and authoritie ouer the other inferiour parts, doe baſely ſubiect themſelues to become ſeruants and ſlaues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fleſh, for the contemptible wages of ſinfull pleaſure. And whereas they were made to rule the body, now they ſpend all their ſtudy and paines in doing ſeruice vnto it, in pampering of the belly and decking and adorning of the backe, and in deuiſing all meanes for the pleaſing of the fleſhly appetite, and ſatisfying of the luſt and carnall concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence. And therefore iuſtly with their rule and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they looſe alſo the honour of their titles, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as whileſt they remained Lords &amp; Kings, they gaue names to the body &amp; inferiour parts, which were called after them reaſonable and ſpirituall, now becomming their ſeruants they looſe their owne names, &amp; are called after their Lords and maiſters whom they haue choſen to ſerue, <hi>fleſhly</hi> and

But all this doth not exempt the ſoule, from being the ſeate alſo of naturall corruption; yea euen the chiefe palace where ſinne dwelleth. Secondly, I anſwere that by body in this place is not meant the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> of the fleſh, but the whole corrupt man, or part vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate both ſoule and body; In which ſenſe the Apoſtle elſewhere calleth himſelfe <hi>carnall,</hi> extending this fleſhly cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruption to his whole perſon; euen as by members wee are to vnderſtand thoſe ſpeciall ſinnes which dwel in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as the Apoſtle in that place of the <hi>Colloſians</hi> explaineth it.

But it may be further vrged, that there are many who haue great knowledge and deepe iudgements, that notwithſtanding are much corrupted in their hearts, paſsions and affections. To which I anſwere, that though they haue ſome knowledge, yet not ſauing knowledge, and though they haue great illumination, yet no ſpirituall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and prudence, to apply this light after an holy maner to particular actions. For this chriſtian prudence in doing any thing, firſt propoundeth the end of the action which moueth vs to vndertake it, and then firſt it rightly councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,

For though he ſhould aſſault vs with a huge army of his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and haue his ſtrength reenforced, and euen twiſe doubled with the aides of all our worldly enemies, yet they could neuer preuaile againſt vs, but ſhould bee ſure of a ſhamefull ouerthrow, vnleſſe theſe inbred enemies did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray vs into their hands, and ſecretly open the gates of our ſoule to let in the troupes of their temptations. The which is apparent in the example of our Sauiour Chriſt, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free from the inward corruption of the fleſh, was not at all endaungered with the outward temptations of the diuel. And whereas the helliſh ſparks of his ſuggeſtions fall into our corrupt hearts (as it were) into tinder or gunpowder, by which they are nouriſhed and much encreaſed in their ſtrength and violence: they did no more worke vpon our bleſſed Sauiour, whoſe pure nature was no iot tainted with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10733:48"/> carnall corruption, then a weake dart that lighteth vpon an impenetrable armour, or a ſmall ſparke of fire that ſhould fall into a ſea of water. Needes then muſt the fleſh bee a daungerous enemy, ſeeing all daunger is by and through it: needes muſt it aboue all be moſt pernitious, ſeeing it expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes vs to all miſchiefe, and nothing without it were able to hurt vs. The which ſhould perſwade vs to bend all our ſtrength againſt it, ſeeing if we ſubdue our carnall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we ſhall eaſily put to flight the diuel and the world; whereas in vaine ſhall we fight and ſtriue againſt theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne forces, if we doe not firſt kill and crucifie theſe ſecret traytors, for no more buſie can we be in building forts and bulworkes to ſtrengthen vs againſt their ſtrong aſſaults, then they will be in raſing and ruinating them, that they may giue an eaſie entrance to theſe outward enemies.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">§ Sect. 2 That in the fleſh dwelleth nothing that is good.</note> But the daungerouſneſſe of this enemy will the better appeare, if we conſider both how daungerous it is in reſpect of it owne nature, and in regard alſo of diuers aduantages which it hath againſt vs in the conflict. The daungerouſnes of it in reſpect of it owne nature will appeare if we conſider that as on the one ſide it is moſt malitious; ſo on the other very mighty and powerfull. The wicked malitiouſneſſe of it may be conſidered both in it ſelfe and in it owne nature, and as it is exerciſed towards vs, that is, the true Chriſtian, or the part regenerate. For the former; the fleſh is ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and malitious, that no good thing remaineth in it, for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10733:49"/> ſo the Apo: plainly confeſſeth, <hi>I know that in me, that is in my fleſh, dwelleth no good thing.</hi> From which abſence of algood, <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18.</note> one of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts giueth the notatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the latin name. <hi>Thou fleſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>art naked and vtterly deſtitute of all vertues,</hi> &amp; <note place="margin">Tu caro cunctis virtutibus denu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>data es, ideoque diceris caro a carendo, quia cares omni bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.

In which reſpect the fleſh is much worſe then the diuell himſelfe; for though he be <hi>wicked,</hi> yea <hi>that wicked one</hi> by a kinde of eminency, yet is there in him ſome relation and reſpects of good, namely as he is the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and in reſpect of his eſſence and ſubſtance, as alſo his gifts of wiſedome, power, ſwiftneſſe, &amp;c. Being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in their owne nature, and not in regard of his abuſe. But in the corrupt fleſh there is nothing but a lumpe and maſſe of ſinne, not any part of Gods workemanſhip, an vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abſence of all good gifts, and nothing but folly, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, dulneſſe, impotency and whatſoeuer may be called by the name of euill; for as it is deſtitute of all good, ſo is it euill in all relations: for as the fleſh is all euill, ſo all euill is in the fleſh, and from the fleſh is all euill. In which reſpect wee may truely ſay that the fleſh is vnto this euill of malitiouſneſſe, <hi>ſubiectum adaequatum,</hi> a ſubiect equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extended vnto it, for there is no part or power of the fleſh which is not wicked and ſinnefull, nor any wickedneſſe of ſinne which is not to be found in this center of wickednes. For firſt the fleſh is wholly wicked and malitious. The (<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note>) <hi>wiſedome</hi> of it is <hi>emnitie againſt God.</hi> The (<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 3. 18. &amp; Eph. 4. 18.</note>) vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it a dungeon of ignorance; the (<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 6. 5 Ier. 13. 23.</note>) <hi>imaginations one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euill and that continually,</hi> the (<note n="d" place="margin">Eph. 4. 19. 2 Tim. 2. 26.</note>) will ſtubburne and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, ſtanding out alwayes in an vtter oppoſition and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate rebellion to the will of God. And if the ſuperiour fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the fleſh bee nothing elſe but a ſincke of ſinne, what can wee expect, but that the inferiour parts muſt in their degree be ſutable in corruption? And therefore as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſinfull men, ſo may wee ſpeake of the fountaine and authour of all their ſinne; <hi>the eyes of it are</hi>

For it is the common ſewer in which all filth and loathſome poyſon of ſinne meeteth: and in a full ſource runneth together; it is the diuels ſtorehouſe of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and his armory in which he layeth vp all the weapons of impietie; It is the ſea of ſinne from which all wickednes floweth, and into which it floweth backe againe. In a word it is the fruitfull wombe into which the diuell caſting the ſeedes and ſpawnes of his helliſh temptations, they receiue warmth, nouriſhment, groweth, and in the ende life and the perfect ſhape of all kinds of ſinne. For there is not any ſinne whatſoeuer though neuer ſo monſtrous and abhommable, but hath it beeing in this wicked fleſh; if not appearing, yet at leaſt ſecretly lurking in this filthy dungeon, if not in the full growth, yet at leaſt in their ſeedes and chiefe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.

And though theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and corruptions doe not alwayes burſt out into the ſores of outward actions; yet (like dangerous impoſtumes) they lye hidden within the body of this fleſh; though they are not alwayes exerciſed in their functions and operations, they being ſubdued with Gods ſanctifying ſpirit in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and with his reſtrayning grace in the vnregenerate, yet theſe curſed habites and hidden faculties doe ſtill remaine, euen in the regenerate in ſome degree, although in part mortified and weakened, and in their full ſtrength in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men. And as the egge hath in it potentially all the parts of the bird, and onely needeth to haue the damme to

Yea this fleſh and fleſhly luſts doe not onely deface the image of God, but euen the image of a man, whileſt they take away from him his reaſon and vnderſtanding, and ſo all difference between him and a beaſt, for through the ſinfull concupiſcence of the corrupt fleſh, man turning away from his Creator to the creatures, looſeth not onely the image of God, but euen the image of himſelfe, and hath the image of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures imprinted vpon him.

Now if we would ſee with what power and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable force, this cruell tyrant did rule in all the ſonnes of men, whileſt they remained in the ſtate of corruption, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it will appeare in that they were ſo vtterly vnable to free themſelues out of this thraldome, that they neuer durſt nor could attempt their libertie, becauſe their wils were no leſſe captiuated, then their other parts and faculties, and it was their chiefe delight to liue in this ſlauery. Neither were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward helps auaileable, becauſe being poſſeſſed and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by this legion of wicked luſts, like the Doemoniake in the Goſpell, nothing would containe them nor reſtraine their fury, but they break eaſily all thoſe chaines, giues, and <note place="margin">Mar. 5. 2.</note> fetters wherwith they vvere bound, being (like mad men) a like harmefull both to themſelues and others. For neither would Gods loue and many benefits allure them and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them in obedience, nor his vvrath and fearfull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments terrifiee and reſtraine them from ſinne; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the law of God, containing ſo many gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to them who obeyed it, and ſo many terrible threatnings againſt them that tranſgreſſed it, both of temporary plagues and euerlaſting puniſhments; nor the execution of theſe dreadfull iudgements in the puniſhment of the whole world
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10733:56"/> by a vniuerſal deluge, of Sodom &amp; Gomorrah with fire and brimſtone, with many other cities &amp; countries which haue beene made examples of Gods wrath againſt ſinne; beſides the experience of innumerable particular perſons, and euen of themſelues, viſited by the hand of God in a fearefull manner, were all ſufficient and ſtrong inough to curbe and keepe vnder, theſe ſinfull paſsions and corrupt luſts, nor to ſubdue and thruſt out of his regency this powerfull tyrant the fleſh; till Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe came who is the wiſdome and power of his father, &amp; conquered him on his croſſe, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing gloriouſly ouer him together with the reſt of our ſpirituall enemies; and vntill he apply the vertue of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory vnto vs and by his powerful ſpirit, which is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtronger then all men and Angels, doe vanquiſh this mighty tyrant, giue him a deadly wound of which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually languiſheth, and depoſing him from his regency, doe ſet vp in our hearts the gracious and glorious king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our bleſſed Sauiour. So that we may conclude this <note place="margin">In Iohan. lib. 3. cap. 34.</note> point with the ſaying of <hi>Cyrill.

Yet this diſcourſe ſo neceſſarily requiring, that I ſhould ſay ſomething of this argument, as that it will ſeeme maymed if it goe without it, I wil a little inſiſt vpon it, and for our more orderly procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I will referre theſe deceipts of the fleſh to two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall heads. The firſt ſuch as reſpect our perſons and ſtates, the other ſuch as concerne certaine duties which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of vs. For the former, it is a common and moſt pernicious policy of the fleſh to perſwade vs, that wee are nothing ſo euill, corrupt and wicked as in truth we are. To the entertaining of which conceipt we are the more eaſily induced by reaſon of ignorance and blindneſſe of minde, pride and ſelfe-loue which naturally raigns and rule in vs. For though we be wholly, from the crowne of the head to the ſole of the foote, defiled with ſinne, and thereby vtterly diſabled vnto any good dutie; yet wee ſee that the moſt haue an opinion of their owne worth and excellencie; For many boaſt themſelues in the goodneſſe of their natures, as though therein they might be accepted, not only of men,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10733:61"/> but alſo of God himſelfe; many vaunt of their pure natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and workes of congruitie, which before grace receiued they are able to performe in the ſtrength of their naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities; many doe reſt in their owne ciuill iuſtice and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie as though it were ſufficient to iuſtifie them in Gods ſight, many bleſſe themſelues in their legall righteouſneſſe, as though therby they could merit heauen with ſome ſmall helpe; and finally many with the Angell of the Church of Laodicia doe thinke themſelues rich and ſo increaſed in goods, that they ſtand in neede of nothing; when as in truth they are wretched and miſerable, poore, blinde and <note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 17.</note> naked. But let vs take heede of this policie as beeing moſt dangerous &amp; pernicious, ſeeing it maketh men reſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and vpon the weake reede of their owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to their vtter perdition, and keepeth them from fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto Chriſt, and from hungring after his righteouſnes by which alone we are iuſtified and ſaued. And as it keepeth vs from imbracing Chriſt by faith, ſo alſo it hindreth our repentance, and nouriſheth in vs carnall ſecuritie and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart: for we muſt firſt ſee our ſinnes before we can euer bewaile or turne from them, and whileſt we haue any opinion of our owne good natures, or our legall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wee can neuer as wee ſhould bewaile our ſinfull cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, nor carefully vſe any meanes to bee purged from them.</p>

The which ſhould moue vs to vſe all our care and indeauour that wee may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feare it: to which purpoſe wee muſt not looke vpon our ſelues as we appeare in the twilight, or rather in the darke night of naturall knowledge, nor yet through the falſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles of pride and ſelfe-loue, which will hide and diſguiſe our vices and corruptions and make them to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:10733:62"/> in vertues colours; but wee muſt looke vpon our ſelues in the glaſſe of the lawe, and try our thoughts and words, our workes and our wayes by the rule of Gods word, and ſo ſhall wee plainely diſcouer our blemiſhes and difilements, yea our monſterous deformities and vgly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, with the auerſeneſſe of our willes to all good, and the peruerſeneſſe and crookedneſſe of our hearts affections. For there ſhall wee ſee that our vnderſtandings are ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that though they be wiſe vnto euill, yet to doe good <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 18.</note> they haue no knowledge; that our iudgements are wholly <note place="margin">Ier. 4. 22.</note> corrupted, miſtaking euill for good, and good for euill, right for wrong, and wrong for right, trueth for falſhood, and falſhood for trueth; that our imaginations are euill and that continually; that our conſciences are either ſeared through ſecuritie or affrighted with terrours and horrours through deſpaire, and either accuſing when they ſhould excuſe, or excuſing when they ſhould accuſe; that our memories are ſlippery to retaine any good thing, and retentiue like braſſe or yron in keeping and preſeruing ſinfull and wicked im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that our willes ſtand in open rebellion againſt God nilling what he willeth, and willeth what he nilleth. That our hearts are auerſe to all goodneſſe and cleaue faſt to all worldly and ſinnefull vanities; that our affections are wholly corrupted and diſordered and all the members of our bodies are the ready inſtruments of ſinne. There ſhall wee finde that by reaſon of this corruption we are notable to thinke a good thought, nor ſo much as will that which is good, that we are altogether vnprofitable ſeruants, yea <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 5. Phill. 2. 12.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:10733:62"/> the blacke-moore may as eaſily change his blackeneſſe, and the leopard his ſpots, as we our ſinnefull condition into a better eſtate; yea that in ſtead of making any ſatisfaction by paying the olde ſcore, we are ready to encreaſe our debt by adding new ſins vnto the olde, and ſo plunge our ſelues into more fearefull condemnation. And thus may we defeate this pollicy of the fleſh and comming vnto a true ſight of our owne naturall vildeneſſe, we may abhorre our ſelues in ſackcloath and aſhes, and renouncing our owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, may hunger after the all-ſufficient righteouſneſſe of <note place="margin">Iob. 42.</note> Chriſt, and applying it vnto vs by a liuely faith may find it effectuall for our iuſtification and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">§ Sect 3. The ſecond pollicie that the good things in vs are much better then in truth they are</note> Secondly as the fleſh perſwadeth vs that we are nothing ſo ill as we are in reſpect of our ſinnefull condition, ſo that the good things which wee ſeeme to haue are farre better and of much greater excellency then in truth they are, and as there it lookes vpon our faults and vices though the thick fogge of ignorance which maketh them to bee ſcarce viſible and diſcernable; ſo when it beholdeth any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of good in vs it putteth on the ſpectakles of pride and ſelfe-loue which make them ſeeme to be farre greater then they are in deede; euery moal-hill a great mountaine, and euery ſmall ſtarre as large as the Sunne it ſelfe. Thus it magnifieth to a meere worldly man the goodneſſe of his nature, as though this alone without any further helpe would bring him to heauen; and maketh him beleeue that his common guifts are ſpeciall endowments, that Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayning grace in him, is ſanctifying and ſauing grace, and his moderated and blunted vices and corruptions to bee ſingular vertues and great perfections. Thus it perſwadeth the proude iuſtifiarie to reſt in his inhaerent righteouſneſſe and legall obedience for his iuſtification and ſaluation. And to this ende it bleareth his eyes ſo as he cannot ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wants and imperfections in it, and worketh in him a conceipt, that it is moſt perfect both in the parts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, when as there is nothing but defects and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus it made the younge man in the Goſpell to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:10733:63"/> boaſt that he had done all commaunded in the law, when <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 20.</note> he had tranſgreſſed all; and to aske after a greater taske, <hi>what lacke I yet,</hi> when as his worke was not ſo much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, <note place="margin">Luke. 18. 11. &amp; 23. 23.</note> and as yet he had done nothing. Thus it made the proude Phariſie to bragge of his legall righteouſneſſe euen vnto God himſelfe, and to reſt in his paying of ſmal tithes, minte, commine and Anniſe, as though he had done the waightie things of the lawe. Finally thus it perſwadeth the ſincere profeſſor to ouerweene his guifts, and to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie aboue meaſure the graces which he hath receiued. It maketh him beleeue that his little mite is a rich treaſury, and his ſmall graine of muſterſeede, and firſt degrees of faith, to be already a great tree; that hee is good wheate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to indure the fanne or the blaſts of any temptations, whereas if Chriſt prayed not for him, that his faith might not faile, hee would when Sathan ſhould ſift him, prooue but light corne, if not very chaffe; Finally that hee is ſo ſtrong in Chriſt, that he can willingly ſuffer martyrdome for his name ſake, and with <hi>Peter</hi> to preſume that though all the world ſhould forſake him, yet he would not; when as the voyce of a poore damoſell will make him ſtart backe, and the ſmalleſt loſſe of goods or impeachment to his credit, will eaſily moue him to abiure his profeſſion. The iſſue of which deceipt is moſt dangerous if by Gods grace it bee not preuented, for the maine ende at which our deceitfull fleſh herein aymeth is, either to puffe vs vp ſo in pride, that wee forget God the ſole authour of our guifts, and ſpoyle him of his praiſe, by arrogating it vnto our ſelues; and that we growe inſolent in reſpect of men, contemning thoſe who in our falſe conceipt come ſhort of vs. And ſecondly that we reſt contented with that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace which we haue, as being abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and neuer vſe any meanes, whereby our imperfect and defectiue graces may be encreaſed and growe to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfection. </p>

And there we ſhall plainely ſee how farre we come ſhort of that perfection which God requireth, what a little pittance it is we haue in compariſon of that which we want, and how our ſmall meaſure is blotted and ſtained with the fleſh of our corruptions. Thirdly, let vs not commend our graces to the eye of our deluded iudgements as ſhopkeepers doe their courſer wares, by ſetting courſer by them; wee haue in our ſight the example of others who come ſhort of vs; but let vs compaire our little ſparkes of grace with thoſe bright flames which haue ſhonne in the Patriarches, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, yea in our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, and ſo we ſhall not be proude of our progreſſe, but aſhamed rather of our ſmall, profitiencie; and with the Apoſtle <hi>forgetting thoſe things which are behinde, and reaching foorth</hi>

They haue knowledge often times in farre greater meaſure then many of Gods deare children; faith, repentance, obedience, and that in ſuch a degree, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10733:69"/> in outward appearance many true Chriſtians come farre ſhort of them. And therefore ſeeing aboue all deceipts this is moſt deceitfull, we are to bend all our care and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that we may diſcouer and defeate it.</p>

That we muſt labour to haue all ſpirituall graces in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and truth. and firſt our knowledg.</note> To which purpoſe wee muſt not onely labour to haue all ſauing graces, and to be enabled vnto the performance of all Chriſtian duties; but alſo after aſſurance that they are in vs and done by vs in ſinceritie and trueth. And to this purpoſe wee are often to examine and waigh them in the ballance of the ſanctuary, and to obſerue the infallible markes and ſignes, whereby our true graces and vertuous actions may be diſcerned, not onely from vices and groſſe corruptions, but alſo from theſe neere counterfaits and ſhadowes of them, which are inſubtill hypocrites and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary beleeuers.

And hereof it is that the knowledge of the hypocrite bringeth ſmall ioy and comfort with it, and though it exceede in meaſure, yet it cheareth not the heart, like the leaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a ſound Chriſtian, euen as the knowledge of the Lawyer in the euidences of a mans lands may be greater

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">§. Sect. 3. How wee may diſcerne a true iuſtifing faith: from that which is temporarie.</note> So alſo hypocrites and temporaries haue faith whereby they not onely know and beleeue the whole word of God and the promiſes of the Goſpell to be true, but alſo giue their aſſent vnto them, yea make ſome kind of application of them vnto themſelues; And yet there are diuers eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall differences betweene this faith of hypocrites and of true beleeuers. For firſt they differ in their cauſes, the one being wrought by the miniſtery of the Goſpell made ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall by the inward cooperation of Gods Spirit; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Sathan &amp; carnal corruption, abuſing and miſapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe promiſes in Chriſt. Secondly in their grounds; for a liuely faith is grounded vpon Gods reuealed trueth, but the faith of hypocrites vpon no other ground then the falſe ſuggeſtions of Sathan, vnwarranted conceipts, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſecuritie and fond preſumption, which cauſe the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite to apply vnto himſelfe the mercies of God, &amp; merits of Chriſt, and the ſweete promiſes of the Goſpell when as he is in no ſort qualified and fitted according to the word to receiue or haue any intereſt in them. For before we can beleeue with a true faith, we muſt be humbled in the ſight and ſenſe of our ſinnes, wee muſt deny our ſelues and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vile in our own eyes and haue an hungring and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting after Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, and an high valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and eſteeme of them aboue all things in the world, all which are wanting in the ſaith of hypocrites. Thirdly true faith is ioyned with vnfained loue of God, for he that is aſſured that much is forgiuen him, he loueth much, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God himſelfe but his neighbours, yea euen his enemies for Gods ſake, and thoſe aboue all the reſt in whom he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the image of God m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt clearely ſhining: But the faith of hypocrites being alwayes accompanied with ſelfe-loue maketh a man to value himſelfe aboue all things, yea God himſelfe the chiefe goodneſſe. Fourthly where there is true faith there is alwayes a ſore combate and conflict betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit, betweene faith purifying
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:10733:70"/> the heart, and vnbeliefe labouring to retaine the pleaſures of ſinne and all our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nbred corruptions which are pleaſing or profitable: but the faith of hypocrites is ſtill quiet and peaceable becauſe it is nothing but carnall preſumption, which being corrupt and ſinnefull agreeth well with other corruptions; neither doeth Sathan moue, or as much as in him lyeth ſuffer to be moued of any queſtions, becauſe hee would poſſeſſe all things in peace, and not haue his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome diuided in it ſelfe. Secondly, true faith is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a mutuall donation, for as it receiueth Chriſt who is giuen vs of God, ſo it offereth and conſecrateth our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſoules vnto Chriſt who by the gift of God hath as much right vnto vs as we vnto him: But the faith of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites would haue part in Chriſt and all his benefits, but Chriſt muſt haue no part in them, or if any at all, hee muſt be contented with their tongue onely, whereas the world and the diuell muſt haue their hearts. Secondly, true faith is not eaſily daunted or diſmayed, but commonly ſhineth moſt clearely in the darke night of afflictions, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth it ſelfe in it chiefe ſtrength, when carnall reaſon will miniſter no comfort; but the faith of hypocrites reſteth onely vpon the proppe of worldly proſperitie which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pulled away ſinketh and fayleth; and whileſt this faire greene blade, which ſpringeth out of the ſtonie ground, is moyſtened with the dewe of temporall benefits, it ſprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp and flowriſheth; but no ſooner doeth the ſunne of affliction and perſecution ariſe but preſently it withereth and fadeth. Laſtly true faith is alwayes a liuing and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full faith, and is continually exerciſed in good workes and Chriſtian duties, and in loue and obedience towards God; but the faith of hypocrites is dead, barren and fruiteleſſe, or if it beare any fruits at all, yet haue they no reſpect to God, but are done out of pride or ſelfe-loue, for feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or hope of rewards. But more of this afterwards. </p>

The difference betweene true and falſe repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> Thus alſo the hypocrite hath ſome kinde of repentance, the which the fleſh commendeth vnto him as greeing well enough with it ſelfe, and that to this ende that he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

Which deceipt that we may preuent we are to learne and obſerue the many differences betweene this counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite and falſe repentance and that which is ſound and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. For true repentance ſpringeth from a liuely faith aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring vs of Gods loue, which cauſeth vs to bewaile our <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10 Luk. 15. 18.</note> ſinnes, becauſe by them wee haue diſpleaſed our gratious God, who ſo loueth vs, and whom we ſo loue: but the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of hypocrites riſeth from infidelitie and ſelfe-loue, which maketh vs mourne becauſe by our ſinnes wee haue made our ſelues obnoxious to puniſhments. Godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ariſeth from a true hatred of ſinne, which being odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vnto vs as an vgly ſerpent, or grieuous as an heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, doth cauſe vs to ſorrow and mourne becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ridde of it, nor ſhake it off; but worldly ſorrowe from our loue of ſinne, becauſe wee are loath to leaue it, and yet muſt needes for feare of further puniſhment. Godly ſorrowe driueth the ſinner to God with <hi>Dauid</hi> and maketh him to humble himſelfe, acknowledge his ſinne and aske pardon; But the ſorrowe of hypocrites driueth men from God, &amp; maketh them to deny their ſinne, or to excuſe and and minſe it. Godly ſorrowe worketh a change and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to amendment of life; but the hypocrite though he hangeth downe his head like a bulruſh for a day, and blub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth his cheekes with teares, yet either hee leaueth not his ſinne at all or onely as he leaueth and putteth of his clothes with a purpoſe to reſume and put them on the next day. Godly ſorrowe doeth chiefely reſpect the ſinne, whereby the Chriſtian hath offended God, but the ſorrow of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites looketh chiefely to the puniſhment whereby they haue diſpleaſed themſelues. Finally, the ſorrowe of the faithfull is conſtant and continual from the firſt day of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion to the ende of their liues; but the ſorrow of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites is but by flaſhes and ſpurts, and commonly ceaſeth when they are freed from their ſmart and paine.</p>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:10733:71"/> obedience. For the obedience of the faithfull ſpringeth from their faith and loue of God, but the obedience of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites from ſelfe-loue and carnall reſpects; the faithfull propound vnto all their good workes the glory of God as their chiefe ende: but the hypocrite propoundeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe chiefely his own good and that in worldly and carnall repects. The true beleeuer performeth totall obedience in reſpect of the ſubiect, with all the powers and parts of his ſoule and body: but the hypocrite contenteth himſelfe with bodily exerciſe which is without the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and doeth not worſhip God in ſpirit and trueth, nor with a willing and chearefull heart, but contradicting the <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> Apoſtles ſpeech he may ſay, <hi>the euill which I loue, that doe I not, but the good which I hate that doe I.</hi> So alſo the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtian performeth totall obedience in reſpect of <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 6.</note> the obiect, and hauing <hi>regard vnto all Gods Commandements,</hi> he fleeth from all ſinne and embraceth all holy duties: yea aboue all ſinnes, hateth thoſe moſt which cleaue faſteſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and laboureth moſt to bring his heart to the loue of thoſe duties to which naturally he is moſt backward. But the hypocrite ſeeming to make conſcience of one table neglecteth the other, or if hee forſaketh many ſinnes and doeth many duties; yet he hath ſome darling ſinnes which <hi>he holdeth as ſweete vnder his tongue,</hi> which hee will by no <note place="margin">Iob. 20. 12.</note> meanes part with, and ſome duties there are ſo contrary to his corrupt nature, that there is no arguments that can bee vſed which can moue him to practiſe them. Finally the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the faithfull is conſtant and permanent, and the longer it continueth, the more it groweth and encreaſeth but the obedience of hypocrites is vnconſtant and by fits onely and flaſhes; and commonly like a naughtie iade hee is moſt free and forward in the beginning of the iourney, but quite tyred before he come neere vnto the end.</p>

For the defeating of which deceipt let vs know, that the leaſt ſinne that is, in it owne nature, offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the infinite Maieſty of God, prouoketh his fierce wrath, ſubiecteth vs to the curſe of the Law, and maketh <note place="margin">Gal 3. 19</note> vs liable, to eternall death and condemnation.

The which anſwerably ſhould bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon him who leaſt offendeth, if Chriſt by bearing his ſmall, as well as his great ſinnes in his body vpon the croſſe, had not freed him from it.

Fourthly let vs know that there is no leſſe danger in ſmall ſins then in thoſe which are great and hainous, firſt becauſe as theſe exceed them in their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie or quantitie, ſo they exceede theſe in number, as being common and ordinarie. Now as the ſhip will bee ſunke as well by many ſmall holes, if they be not ſtopped, as at a great leake, and may be ouerburthened and periſh as well by a multitude o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Secondly becauſe ſmall ſinnes are commonly accompanied with impenitency, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie and hardnes of hart; and men not regarding them, doe like and liue in them without deſire of amendment; whereas thoſe which are haynous, making deepe wounds and gaſhes in the heart and conſcience, doe cauſe men to be more ſenſible of them, and more earneſt in looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the core; as we may ſee in the example of the Phariſes and publicans: now our other ſinnes though neuer ſo dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, yet will not condemne vs, if they be not ioyned with impenitencie, and contrariwiſe the moſt veniall ſinne wil proue vnpardonable, if we liue and dye in it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Whereof it is that our Sauiour telleth the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes, that Publicanes and ſinners ſhould goe to heauen before them. For as ſmall ſparkes of fire lighting in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible matter, wil if they be not quenched burne a whole Citie, and contrariwiſe a great flame doth little hurt if it be ſpeedily put out; ſo if the leaſt ſparkes of ſinne bee nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the oyle o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Laſtly, let vs know that the allurements which the fleſh vſeth to make vs liue
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10733:75"/> in ſmall ſinnes without repentance are vaine and friuolous. For if wee doe not deſire and indeauour to be Saints on earth, we ſhall neuer become Saints in heauen, if we doe not labour to ſhake off dayly our imperfections, and to grow vnto more perfection in this life, wee ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer attaine vnto it in the life to come; if we doe not ſeeke to be <hi>pure in heart,</hi> we ſhall neuer be bleſſed in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God. If we be not preciſe and conſcionable in fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 8.</note> the leaſt ſinnes, we ſhall ſurely become ſecure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuons. Moreouer let vs remember that the leaſt ſins are not fraileties and infirmities, if we liue in them ſecurely and wilfully; as contrariwiſe the greateſt may deſerue this name if we commit them ſuddenly, and riſe out of them ſpeedily. Euen as a man may be ſaid to fall through weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and infirmitie into a deepe gulfe, when as ſlipping at vnawares he vſeth all his indeauour to recouer himſelfe; and on the other ſide it is not weakeneſſe but wilfulneſſe, if he fall but into a ſhallow ditch, if hee will not labour to get out againe, but lyeth grouelling in the water vntill he be drowned. Let vs know, that though in <hi>many things wee ſinne all,</hi> yet they who belong to God doe not make a trade of wilfull ſinning, and being ſometime ouertaken they are not at reſt till they haue riſen again by vnfained repentance and though there be none ſo iuſt who ſinneth not, yet all who will be ſaued, muſt be ſo iuſt as not to ſuffer it to raigne in them. And finally that though the beſt of the Saints, Patriarches and Apoſtles had their infirmities, yet none of them could euer be found that nouriſhed, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and continued in them wittingly and willingly, after their iudgements haue beene rightly informed and their conſciences conuinced. And therefore the examples of their ſlips will not countenance our wilfull ſinnes, no not our leaſt infirmities, yea rather it will make vs the more vnexcuſable if ſeeing them fall (as it were) before vs, we doe not looke the better to our footing.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:10733:76"/> bringeth to abnegation and apoſtacy. That neglect of holy duties ends commonly in open prophanation; that filthy words draw many on to filthy actions, and that when once men haue giuen way to vnlawfull courſes for the getting of ſome ſmall competency, they will much more continue in them for the obtaining of aboundance. Neither in truth is any other thing reaſonably to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; For doe we thinke that we can driue away beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars from our doores by vſing euery day to caſt them ſcraps, or that they will be weary of crauing till they ſee vs to be weary of giuing? Can we quench the fire of our concupiſcence by caſting oyle vpon it? Or ſatisfie our dropſie deſires by giuing them a little drinke? Is it a ſafe way to let little theeues which are of the ſame company lodge in our houſes, to keepe out great one, and preſerue our goods? Is it the beſt meanes to ſet fire on the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, that the reſt of the houſe may be preſerued from burning? And will it not rather creepe from thence to the Hall, Parlour and the reſt of the building. Finally is it held good policy to giue our enemy leaue, to make ſome ſmall breaches in our wals, whereby he may enter and ſurprize vs, to ſuffer him to haue ſome competent allowance and quiet poſſeſsion in ſome corners of our Cities, and not rather to keepe him aloofe, and vtterly to ſtarue and famiſh him, ſo as he may haue no ſtrength to aſſault and indanger vs?

Thus when the Prophet told <hi>Hazaell</hi> what horrible outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges hee ſhould commit, he was ſo blinded with this deceipt of the fleſh, that he would not beleeue it, but cryed out vnto him, <hi>what is thy ſeruant a dogge, that I ſhould doe ſuch things.</hi> And when our Sauiour told <hi>Peter,</hi> that he ſhould <note place="margin">2 King. 8. 13.</note> deny and abiure him, conſulting onely with his fleſh, hee was ready to preſume vpon his owne ſtrength, and rather doubted of his Maiſters trueth, then of his owne courage and fidelitie. Now by this decipt we are made wretchleſſe and ſecure, and keepe no watch ouer our ſelues, becauſe we feare no aſſault of ſuch enemies, whereby it commeth to paſſe that we are ſuppriſed at vnawares, and carried captiue of ſinne becauſe we neuer expected, and therefore neuer armed our ſelues againſt ſuch mightie enemies; as we may ſee in the example of <hi>Dauid</hi> who hauing long made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſmall infirmities and ſeriouſly repented euen for his ſecret ſlips and leaſt ſinnes, neuer feared falling into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">§ Sect. 7. The ſeuenth pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie is to draw vs from things indifferent to ſin.</note> A ſeuenth pollicy of the fleſh is, to drawe vs from that which indifferent and in it owne nature lawfull, vnto that which is vnlawfull and ſinnefull; for whereas things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent are not ſimply good, but onely in their right and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate vſe, the fleſh allureth vs to abuſe them through immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and exceſſe, whereby they become ſinnefull and euill. Thus becauſe the creatures are good in their owne nature: and the bleſsing of God vnto vs if they be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the word &amp; prayer, and be vſed ſoberly for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fitting and enabling vs to Gods ſeruice, and for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all religious and Chriſtian duties, the fleſh allureth vs to loue them exceſsiuely more then the creator himſelfe and then all ſauing graces and heauenly happines, and ſo chiefly to value, affect and ſeeke them and to place all our happineſſe in the fruition of them. Thus becauſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:10733:80"/> riches, honours and pleaſures, are in their owne nature good, it perſwadeth vs to loue them exceſsiuely, to ſet our hearts vpon them and ſeeke them more diligently then the kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe, and ſo through our abuſe to make them become vnto vs ſhamefull Idols with which we commit ſperituall whoredome. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe recreations are lawfull, if we vſe them lawfully, ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, and with moderation, that ſo we may be the better enabled for the duties of Gods ſeruice, it allureth vs to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe them through exceſſe, and to ſpend all, or the chiefe part of our time in them, whereby of recreations they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come occupations, which take vs wholly vp, and ſhoulder and thruſt out all Chriſtian duties of our callings with all religious duties of Gods ſeruice, or to vſe them vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably on the Lords day, which ſhould be conſecrated as holy vnto him, and be wholly ſpent in diuine duties and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious exerciſes. So becauſe meates and drinkes are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and of an indifferent nature, the fleſh draweth vs to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe them by intemperance and exceſſe, ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe, and ſo to become groſſe epicures who make their belly their God. Becauſe apparrell is neceſſary to keepe vs warme and hide our nakedneſſe, the fleſh perſwadeth vpon this ground to exceſsiue brauery, and ſtrange attyers: becauſe ſleepe is warrantable in the moderate vſe of it, it allureth vs to immoderate ſloth and ſluggiſhneſſe, which conſumeth our precious time, and ſo dulleth the ſpirits, that we are made vnfit for any good duties. And finally becauſe honeſt mirth is commendable, it prouoketh vs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely to embrace carnall delights, and paſſing all bonds of ſobriety, to turne our mirth into madneſſe, to the diſhonor of God, the diſcredite of our profeſsion and the wounding of our owne conſciences. And thus the fleſh ſpurreth vs on in the vſe of theſe things indifferent, and neuer ſuffereth vs to reſt, vntill we haue wholly paſſed the bonds which God hath ſet vs, and haue turned our Chriſtian and lawfull libertie into vnchriſtian and lawleſſe licentiouſneſſe. The which deceipt is ſo much the more daungerous, becauſe it
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:10733:80"/> inticeth vs to the embracing of thoſe things, vnto which we are naturally carried and hurried with our carnall deſires, and ſinfull appetites; as alſo becauſe the things wherein we offend are in our owne nature lawfull and the good bleſsings of God, which maketh vs ſecurely to vſe them, neuer ſuſpecting any daunger. Now if we would not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken with this pollicy, we muſt keepe a vigilant watch ouer our ſelues in the vſe of things indifferent, that our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie doe not turne to libertiniſme. Let vs conſider not onely what is lawfull, but alſo what is expedient in reſpect time, place, perſons and other circumſtances, which not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerued, things lawful in themſelues become vnlawful vnto vs through our abuſe; that they who will alwaies doe the vttermoſt that they may, wil often doe that which they ſhould not; and they who will preſumptuouſly walke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the brinke of the riuer, will ſometimes ſlip in and be in daunger to be drowned; that theſe things which are not abſolutely good, but of an indifferent nature, are vnto vs according as we vſe them, good to thoſe which vſe them well, and euill to thoſe who abuſe them vnto ſinne; that we are naturally exceeding inclinable to this abuſe, if we be not very watchfull and wary; and finally that thoſe things which are not ſimply good, but as they are confined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their bonds and meaſure, their cautions and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, become euill and vnlawfull, when theſe limits are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded and theſe cautions not obſerued.</p>

The firſt whereof is to

For when God ſuffereth vs to goe on in our euill wayes without checke, we either thinke that he approueth, or not much miſliketh them; or elſe continue ſecurely in them and neuer call them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">§ Sect 3. Secondly the fleſh teacheth vs to pretend cuſtome.</note> Secondly men excuſe themſelues for liuing impenitent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their ſinnes, by pretending cuſtome, which hath taken ſuch faſt hold vpon them, that they can by no meanes ſhake it off. Thus the ſwearer pretendeth, that he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaue vaine and blaſphemous oathes, but that he is ſo inured vnto them, that he often ſweareth at vnawares. Thus the voluptuous man ſaith, that he would be content to leaue his carnall delights, as drinking gaming, rioting, whoring, but that hee hath ſo accuſtomed himſelfe vnto them, that he cannot forſake them nor giue them euer. But let ſuch know that it is high time for them to come out of their ſinnes by repentance, ſeeing they haue brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into a moſt miſerable and fearefull condition; for ſinne is turned into another nature, and by pleading cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome holdeth them in ſubiection (as it were) by vertue of a law. And Sathan who through their naturall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on held them in the vileſt and baſeſt ſlauerie, hath his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion confirmed by their cuſtomable ſeruice of him in their actuall tranſgreſsions, and now the ſtrong man hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the houſe with ſome ſhew of right, hauing ſo long poſſeſſed it that he can pleade preſcript on. Of theſe men I would demaund if euer they meane to come out of their ſinnes by vnfained repentance or no. If not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of hope is there but that they muſt be eternally mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable in the fire of hell. But if they doe as all will pretend, why doe they it not preſently. For if cuſtome be too ſtrong for them already, how much more vnreſiſtable will it be, when it is more and more confirmed by much practiſe and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10733:82"/> continuance? But I am ſo fettered in ſin by an ill cuſtome, that I cannot ſhake it off. Yet know that though it be hard, yet vpon the neceſsity of thy ſaluation it muſt be done; and therefore in ſtead of breaking theſe cords with a <hi>Sampſon</hi> like reſolution, let not time and vſe double them and make them ſtronger. Yea rather vntwiſt them by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, if thou canſt not at once breake them; and by a contrary cuſtome of piety and righteouſneſſe, diſuſe thee from thy ſinnes by degrees, indeauouring firſt to ſet thy heart at liberty. For if the heart being deliuered out of the bondage of ſinne, begin now to hate it, then neither will the tongue delight to ſpeake it, nor the hand to act it. And therefore pretend not cuſtome, ſeeing it is not this, but our malicious wils, that imbrace it and our hearts that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, which make vs continue in our ſinne without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, neither can cuſtome hold vs vnto any thing which is in our owne power to alter, if our wils with any reſolution doe breake away from it. For tell me thou who pretendeſt this excuſe; if this cuſtome ſhould be puniſhed in euery particular act with ſome forfeiture, whereby thy eſtate would be impoueriſhed, or ſome puniſhment infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on the body, which would bring vnto thee more da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and ſmart, then thy ſinne doth pleaſure and delight; wouldeſt thou not leaue thy ſinne and hate it, if not for it ſelfe, yet for the penalty ſake inflicted on thee for it? And wilt thou not regard thy precious ſoule as well as thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible body; and be as carefull to auoide eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as well as ſome worldly loſſe? Finally know, that it will proue but a miſerable excuſe at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when God and our owne conſciences ſhall accuſe vs for our ſinnes, to ſay that we committed and could not leaue them, becauſe we were accuſtomed vnto them; and all one, as if the man-ſlayer ſhould excuſe his murther, by telling the iudge that he could doe no otherwiſe, becauſe he had for a long time beene accuſtomed thereto, by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of many other: Or as if the thiefe ſhould excuſe his theft by ſaying, that he could not chooſe but doe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10733:83"/> his hands for a long time haue beene inured to ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

For one thing is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and happy are we, if with <hi>Mary</hi> we quite our ſelues of worldly incumbrances and chooſe the better part.

That we haue Gods gracious promiſe of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſaries, if we firſt and chiefely ſeeke his kingdome and righteouſnes: That pouerty, if we vſe it well, is no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to grace in this life nor glory in the life to come; as we ſee in the example of the Diſciples, yea Chriſt himſelfe, who being moſt poore in worldly things, were <note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 10.</note> moſt rich in ſpirituall and heauenly treaſures. Finally let vs know, that if we ſerue and ſeeke the Lord, he will take care for vs, and not ſuffer vs to want any thing which is good, and that they of all others are beſt prouided for, who haue his prouidence to watch ouer them. Or though we ſhould be pinched in reſpect of earthly things, yet it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with <hi>Lazarus</hi> to goe poore to heauen, then with <hi>Diues</hi> hauing abundance, to be caſt into hell.</p>

That it is no great matter to ſuffer aſcoffe for Chriſt, who hath for our ſakes ſuffered the bitter death of the croſſe; that we muſt not refuſe to be the ſheepe of Chriſt, nor alter our nature to a woluiſh condition, becauſe wee would not be iniured by wolues and goates, vnleſſe we would with them be ſet at Chriſts left hand and heare that dreadfull ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation denounced againſt vs. That wee ſhall in the <note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> end ouercome by ſuffering, and receiue a crowne of our

Let vs further conſider that no man is careleſſe of the health of his body, becauſe the ayre is infected, and the country full of contagious ſicknes, but doth ſo much the more carefully vſe all good preſeruatiues to keepe him from theſe Epedemical diſeaſes, and the like care we would haue of our ſoules, if we loued them as well as we doe our bodies. In regard whereof the Apoſtle vſeth this as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to make vs more watchfull and diligent, <hi>in redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the time, becauſe the dayes are euill.</hi> Finally let vs know <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 16.</note> that neither time nor place in which we liue, will excuſe vs before God, if we liue in our ſinnes, ſeeing as the beſt time or place will not priuiledge vs from falling into ſinne no not Paradiſe it ſelfe, and the ſociety of the Angels, as we ſee in <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo neither will thoſe times and places which moſt abound with euill poiſon vs with the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of ſinne, if wee haue about vs the preſeruatiue of a good conſcience, and haue ſincere and vpright hearts, which make vs with <hi>Enoch</hi> in the middeſt of worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to <hi>walke with our God.</hi> Yea rather when wee are <note place="margin">Gen. 5.</note> on all ſides compaſſed about with wicked men, the heate and zeale of our godlineſſe (as it were by an antiperiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis) will be intended and increaſed.

Secondly, let vs knowe that howſoeuer Gods mercy in it ſelfe is infinit and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, yet in reſpect of the obiect and exerciſe of it, it is limitted by his truth, which appropriateth it only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinners, becauſe ſuch onely doe lay hold of it, and apply it vnto themſelues by a liuely faith; without which application, the mercy of God can doe vs no more good, then a ſoueraigne ſalue can cure a wound, which is caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the doore and neuer applied vnto it. Laſtly, let vs know, that as God is infinite in mercy, ſo alſo in iuſtice, yea in trueth theſe are all one in God, his mercy being a iuſt mercy, and his iuſtice a mercifull iuſtice, onely they ſeeme to differ in reſpect of the obiect, and diuers maner of exerciſing them towards his creatures. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard notwithſtanding it may truely be ſaide, that hee is <hi>iuſt in iuſtifying a ſinner,</hi> becauſe beleeuing in Chriſt his ſinnes <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 26.</note> are ſatisfied for by his merits and obedience; and that he is mercifull towards the wicked in bearing with them ſo long, and affording vnto them ſo many meanes to bring them to repentance. But if theſe meanes be contemned, then the acceptable time and day of ſaluation being paſt, there is no more place for mercy, but onely for iuſtice; in the manifeſtation whereof towards the wicked and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10733:86"/> God is no leſſe glorified, then in the declaring of his mercy and trueth towards the faithfull and Elect. Neither muſt we thinke it any diſparagement to Gods mercy, that it is not effectuall for the ſaluation of all, ſeeing the fault is in themſelues who deſpiſe it; neither is the infiniteneſſe thereof at all limited or ſhadowed, becauſe it is not exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to thoſe who reiect it, no more then the mercy of the Prince is ecclypſed, who ſendeth his pardon to a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour with this condition, that he ſhall haue the benefite of it, if he will receiue and pleade it; and for the time preſent be ſorry for his fault, and for the time to come endeauour to amend; and yet afterwards hangeth the offender, when he refuſeth to receiue it, and withall profeſſeth his reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to continue in his wicked courſes. Beſides the infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods mercy is not onely manifeſted by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which he forgiueth, but alſo by the quality and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the debt which he pardoneth and remitteth. In which regard the infinite grace and goodneſſe of God would clearely ſhine in the ſaluation of one ſinner though there were no more then he, becauſe he forgiueth the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite guilt and puniſhment of his ſinne, whereby he hath offended his infinite maieſtie.</p>

The ſeuenth pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie of the fleſh in perſwading vs to deferre our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> Laſtly, if the fleſh cannot drawe vs to a reſolution of liuing in our ſinnes without repentance; then it allureth vs to deferre it from time to time, becauſe it will neuer be too late to performe this duty though it were delayed to the laſt houre of our liues; which deceipt that we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate, let vs know, that this is a like abuſe of Gods infinite mercy and goodneſſe, when as by our preſumption we make it ſerue as a reaſon to continue vs in our ſins, which ſhould be the chiefeſt motiue to haſten our repentance. Secondly let vs conſider that we haue no aſſurance of our liues for the ſpace of one houre, nor that we ſhall haue power to repent, if we deſpiſe Gods preſent grace though our liues ſhould be prolonged for many yeeres. Thirdly, that without repentance there can be no ſaluation, which being the chiefe thing, deſerueth our firſt and beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10733:86"/> and what folly is it to ſeeke firſt for vaine and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary trifles, and to defer this greateſt and moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant buſineſſe to our laſt and vncertaine times, ſeeing if we be preuented by death there is no hope, but that we ſhall goe vnto hell. Fourthly let vs knowe that the longer we deferre our repentance, the more hard and difficult ſhall we finde it to be done, for if we cannot ſhake off our ſins, when like ſtrangers they are firſt entertained, much leſſe ſhall wee bee able to doe it, when they are of familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, yea by long cuſtome become habituall, and as it were turned into a ſecond nature. Finally let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that this late repentance is commonly falſe and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaite, not ſpringing out of faith and the loue of God, but out of ſelfe-loue and feare of approaching iudgements. The which lamentable experience maketh too manifeſt, ſeeing few among many hundreds performe that which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, when the hand of God correcting them is pulled backe, but after their recouery out of thoſe ſickeneſſes which they thought mortall, returne to their former cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yea become more worldly and wicked then euer they were before. But of this argument I haue largely intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the firſt part of this Chriſtian warfare, and therefore will content my ſelfe heere to haue ſo briefely touched it.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue heard of ſome notable deceipts which the fleſh vſeth to drawe vs vnto ſinne, and being fallen to make vs lye in it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: now let vs conſider of ſome chiefe pollicies which it vſeth about holy duties and vertuous actions. And theſe are of three ſorts; the firſt it vſeth to hinder vs from embracing and practiſing them.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10733:87"/> The ſecond to diſturbe and inturrupt vs in them, the third to alinate our hearts and withdrawe vs from them. For the firſt; it vſeth many deceipts to keepe vs from embracing vertue and bringing forth the fruits of new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. As firſt of all when wee haue ſome inclination to embrace vertue and to practiſe Chriſtian duties in the generall, it cunningly indeauoureth to dazle the eyes of our minde, and to corrupt our iudgements, that wee may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake vertue for vice, and good for euill. To which ende it either moueth vs to iudge of them according to common error, and the falſe opinion of worldly men, who by ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue are eaſily brought to condemne that as naught, which is moſt contrary to their carnall appetite; or elſe it diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vertues beautie with the foule and vgly vizard of vice and ſinne, or ſo beſprinkleth and beſmeareth them with the blacke colours of falſe imputations, that wee are ready to abhorre and reiect them at the firſt view; without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther triall or examination. Thus it brandeth a Chriſtian conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the name of a malancholick or monkiſh life, deuotion with the name of ſuperſtition, and a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable care to approue our hearts and all our wayes vnto God it tearmeth nice ſcrupuloſitie, and needleſſe, yea pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh preciſeneſſe. Thus a religious care to ſanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath it calleth Iudaiſme, zeale, fury and madneſſe, or at beſt raſhneſſe and indiſcretion; humilitie it tearmeth baſeneſſe, magnanimitie pride, bounty lauiſhneſſe, frugalitie niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, meekeneſſe cowardize, and Chriſtian courage and fortitude it intitleth with the name of deſperate and auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious boldneſſe. Now the meanes to preſerue vs from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouertaken with this deceipt, is to pull of theſe defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vizards, and to behold vertue and all Chriſtian duties, in their owne natiue beauty by the neuer deceiuing light of Gods word. And not to liſten to the falſe opinion of the world and the fleſh, which make light darkneſſe, and ſweet ſower, but to examine by the Scriptures what God appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and what he diſliketh and condemneth. To which purpoſe wee muſt daily exerciſe our ſelues in the ſtudy and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:10733:87"/> meditation of Gods word, which will ſo enlighten, rectifie and informe our iudgements, that we ſhall neuer be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by thoſe foggy and falſe miſtes, which the diuell, the world or our owne corrupt fleſh, doe caſt before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">§ Sect 2. The ſecond poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in alledginge difficulties that are in chriſtian duties.</note> A ſecond deceipt which the fleſh vſeth, to diſcourage vs from ſeeking after vertue, and endeauouring to practiſe Chriſtian duties, is to perſwade vs, that the houſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is ſcituated on ſo high an hill, that wee ſhall be out of breath and quite tyred before we can clime vnto it; and that there is ſo much difficultie and ſo many diſcouragements in a Chriſtian life, that it would be but in vaine to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, it being impoſſible that we ſhould goe forward, and that better it were not to giue the onſet, then in the firſt skirmiſh to bee foyled, and forced to make a ſhamefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traite. To this ende it is ready to tell vs, that we muſt leaue all our delights, which ſo much content vs, and exerciſe our ſelues in ſuch duties as are quite againſt the haire, and through the contrarietie which is betweene them and our nature, ſo diſpleaſant and diſtaſtfull to our appetite, that we ſhall not liue one merry day after wee haue taken vpon vs this mopiſh and melancholicke profeſſion. Yea and for the better countenancing of this deceipt, it is ready to abuſe Gods infallible trueth, and to ſet before vs the afflictions of the Saints, their mournings and lamentations, the pouertie and reproaches, in priſonments, baniſhments and cruell death, aſſuring vs (as the trueth is) that if we follow them in the ſame courſes we ſhal meete with the ſame croſſes, ſeeing it is expreſſely ſaide, <hi>that all who will liue godly in Chriſt Ieſus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3 12.</note> 
                  <hi>muſt ſuffer perſecution.</hi> Now that we may be armed againſt this ſubtill incounter, let vs knowe, that the chiefe ſtrength of it lyeth in laying open and amplifying the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which might hinder vs in our Chriſtian courſe, and in the concealing and hyding of thoſe helpes and comforts which might be encouragements to our good proceedings. For though the worke of repentance bee vnto vs hard and difficult, yet ſeeing it is not onely an act done by vs, but chiefely and principally a grace and gift of God, who is
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:10733:88"/> ready to beſtow it freely vpon al who deſire to haue it, and doe endeauour to embrace and practiſe it, the difficultie ſhould bring with it no diſcouragement, ſeeing God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to effect his owne worke, and by the power of his word and ſpirit, to make that eaſie and delightfull which is naturally impoſsible and vnpleaſant. Againe let vs knowe that in repentance there is a change not onely of our actions, but alſo of our hearts and mindes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it commeth to paſſe, that thoſe ſinnefull delights which were formerly moſt ſweete to our carnall appetites, are now moſt bitter and loathſome to the part regenerate; and thoſe godly and religious exerciſes which were to the fleſh and naturall man moſt diſtaſtfull and tedious, are now to the man regenerate moſt pleaſant and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as wee may ſee in <hi>Dauid</hi> who eſteemed Gods word and holy ordinances <hi>aboue all maner of riches,</hi> and found <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. &amp;. 119</note> them ſweeter to his taſt <hi>then the hony or the hony combe;</hi> and in <hi>Iob</hi> who profeſſeth, that hee eſteemed the <hi>word of God much more then his neceſſary foode.</hi> And therefore though new <note place="margin">Iob. 23. 12.</note> obedience be irk ſome and painfull to thoſe who are vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, yet not to thoſe who are ſanctified, changed and renewed in the ſpirit of their mindes. Euen as wee ſee thoſe paines and ſerious ſtudies which were ſo tedious and contrary to our diſpoſition whileſt we were children, are ſweete and delightfull when we are come to yeeres of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. Furthermore let vs conſider that though it bee a moſt toyleſome labour vnto vs to runne in the Chriſtian race being conſidered in our ſelues, becauſe wee are ſtiffe and benummed, and ſore and lame in all our ioynts through the fetters and boults of ſinne which haue long hanged vpon vs, yet being ſtrengthened by the ſpirit, and being made partakers of this ſpirituall annoynting, we are made able, nimble and actiue to run in the wayes of God, according to that of the ſpouſe, <hi>Drawe me, and we will runne after thee,</hi> and of the Prophet; <hi>I will runne the way of thy</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 4. Pſal 1 19. 32. Phil. 4. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Commaundements when thou ſhalt inlarge my heart;</hi> and that alſo of the Apoſtle; <hi>I can doe all things through Chriſt which</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:10733:88"/> 
                  <hi>ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> Finally let vs knowe, that as wee haue in the way of Chriſtianity many croſſes, ſo alſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, as for example, for the preſent we looſe the applauſe of worldlings, and lye open to obloquie and reproach; but for recompence we haue the approbation of God and our owne conſciences; wee haue warres with men, but peace with God; we looſe carnal reioycing in the pleaſures of ſin, but inſtead thereof we haue ſpiritull reioycing in the aſſurance of Gods loue, the remiſsion of our ſins, and the ſaluation of our ſoules; we are ſtripped of worldly wealth, but we are inriched with ſpirituall treaſures, Gods ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying gifts and graces, and gloriouſly decked both with inward ſinceritie and the rich roabes of an holy conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we forgoe carnall ſecuritie which within a while would bring vs into horrour and deſpaire in the ſight of our ſins, and that horrible vengeance which is due vnto them; but we haue in exchange ſpirituall ſecuritie, whereby we quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt vpon Gods promiſes and prouidence in the middeſt <note place="margin">Pſal. 23. 4.</note> of all daungers, and can with <hi>Dauid</hi> walke through the vale of the ſhadowe of death, and yet feare no euill. And thus our worldly loſſes are euen in this life infinitly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced with our ſpirituall gaines, and how much more when we come to the fruition of our future and heauenly <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 12. Rom. 8. 18.</note> hopes, for if we <hi>ſuffer with Chriſt we ſhall raigne with him, and theſe preſent ſufferings, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be reuealed in vs; for they are light and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>momentary; but they ſhall cauſe vnto vs a farre moſt excellent and an eternall waight of glory.</hi> And therefore let vs not ſo remember the croſſe, as that we forget the crowne, nor ſo looke to the fouleneſſe of the way, as that we doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the gloriouſneſſe of our pallace vnto which wee are trauayling; but let vs conſider that by mount <hi>Caluarie</hi> we ſhall come vnto mount <hi>Sion</hi> the Citie of the Saints, and that by our <hi>many tribulations wee ſhall enter into the kingdome of</hi>

                  <hi>heauen.</hi> And ſo ſhall we with <hi>Moſes,</hi> preferre <hi>afflictions with the people of God, before the enioying of ſinfull pleaſures which laſt but for a ſeaſon, and eſteeme the reproach of Chriſt greater</hi>

                  <hi>riches then the treaſures of this worldly Egypt, hauing reſpect to the recompence of reward.</hi> Yea ſo ſhal we be like vnto Ieſus <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> Chriſt, the <hi>author and finiſher of our faith, who for the ioy that was ſet before him, endured the croſſe, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is now ſet downe at the right hand of the throne of God,</hi> where we alſo ſhall ſit with him if we follow his example.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">§ Sect. 3.

That thoſe duties which are firſt in excellency, ſhould be firſt alſo in time, and that no wiſe man putteth off matters of greateſt waight, but giueth them prioritie and precedencie both in reſpect of time and place. Let vs remember that our liues are ſhort and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie, and that it were but all too little, though they ſhould be wholly ſpent in Gods ſeruice; and that this ſhort time is ſo vncertaine, that we haue no aſſurance of liuing another day or houre, in regard whereof it is great mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to put off thoſe duties, for the doing whereof we chiefely came into the world, and vpon the performance of them our ſaluation dependeth, and to prefer before them trifles, which for the preſent are of ſmall value and will not profit vs any whit at the day of death and iudgement.

Now the meanes to fruſtrate this pollicy is wiſely to diſcerne it, and to obſerue and ſet a watch ouer our hearts, that they may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and onely intend the well performing of thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about which we are employed, that ſo wee may doe them with all our might: for as the prouerbe is, <hi>hee that huntetb after two hares at once, ſhall catch neither;</hi> and as nature intendeth not many things at once, ſo neither doeth grace; becauſe the vertue and powers either of body or minde, being diſtracted by diuers obiects, doe (like the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer diuided into many ſtreames) but weakely performe their functions and operations, and being vnited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are much more ſtrong and actiue.</p>

And thus when wee are purpoſed to pray vnto God, it perſwadeth vs to delayes, vnder this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that we may afterwards performe this duty more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, when wee are not ſo dull and heauy, ſo troubled with diſtractions, nor ſo aſſaulted with temptations. And thus generally it diſwadeth vs from performing any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto God, pretending that wee may haue afterwards better meanes and fitter opportunitie, and ſo may doe it in ſuch manner as may bee more acceptable vnto God. And thus alſo it moueth vs to neglect the workes of mercy all our life long, pretending that we may doe them much more amply and liberally by our laſt will, which taketh not effect till after death. For the defeating of which pollicy let vs knowe, that we cannot performe ſeruice vnto God till hee calleth and enableth vs by his ſpirit thereunto, and that we are called when the Lord offers meanes and opportunitie, which if we neglect, we knowe not whether hee will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards honour vs ſo much as to appoint vs to theſe holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices which we haue careleſly &amp; cauſleſly omitted.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus the fleſh hindereth vs from the performance of all good duties. In the performance of them it dealeth alſo no leſſe deceiptfully, and that either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turrupt and diſtract vs, that wee may doe them onely formally and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or elſe ſo to corrupt and poyſon our beſt graces and moſt vertuous actions, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vnprofitable, yea hurtfull vnto vs. For the former when we endeauour to ſeeke the Lord in his holy ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſet our ſelues to performe the pious duties of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, if it cannot by the former deceipts wholly hinder vs from doing of them, it will (like <hi>Dauids</hi> falſe friend) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company vs to the houſe of God, as though it likewiſe were delighted in theſe holy exerciſes; but to no other ende, but that it may fruſtrate and defeate our holy deſires. For when we labour to heare Gods word, to call vpon his name, or ſinge his praiſes, <hi>this ſinne that hangeth on vs and preſſeth vs downe,</hi> doeth either make vs dull and drowſie, lumpiſh and heauy, ſo that we cannot attend theſe holy exerciſes with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chearefulneſſe and alacritie of ſpirit, but offer vnto God dead and carrion-like ſacrifices, which hauing no heart nor life in them are loathſome vnto him: or elſe it worketh our minds to ſome carnall proiudice or diſlike of our teachers, or of ſome paſſages in his Sermon, whereby we are affected with choller and ſpleene towards him; or to thinke meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and baſely of him in reſpect of ſome naturall infirmities or defects; or elſe becauſe of the mediocritie of his guifts; or it hangeth ſo heauily on vs that it maketh vs weary of theſe holy exerciſes before they be halfe ended. Or if non of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10733:92"/> theſe, yet it will neuer faile to diſtract our mindes with worldly cogitations and wandring thoughts, ſo as wee cannot intend theſe religious duties, but performe them with the lippes, eares, and outward man, but not with the heart, in ſhewe and ceremony, but not in ſpirit and trueth. And thus the fleſh like <hi>Iudas</hi> waiteth vpon vs that it may betray vs, it goeth with vs into Gods market, that it may hinder vs from buying any ſpirituall merchandize, it thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in with vs into Gods armory, when as we goe to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our ſelues with ſpirituall weapons, that it may make vs neglect them and leaue them behinde vs, or elſe ſo weaken vs that we cannot carry them with vs; it will like <hi>Huſhai</hi> force kindneſſe vpon vs, and by no perſwaſions will ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde vs; but it is to this ende that by cunning pollicy it may fruſtrate our enterpriſes, &amp; ſo betray vs into the hands of our enemies. For the defeating of which pollicy our beſt courſe is, to leaue behinde our chiefe corruptions by renewing of our repentance, before we come to performe theſe holy exerciſes, and keepe vnder thoſe which we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with vs, watching ouer them with all diligence, that they doe not diſtract nor hinder vs. To which ende wee muſt come vnto theſe holy duties with due preparation, and being come we muſt meditate on Gods glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence before whom we ſtand, we muſt with all diligence looke to our hearts, becauſe that the Lord chiefely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them in all duties of his ſeruice; we muſt thinke of the excellency, waight and fruite of theſe Religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, that our hearts being inflamed with the loue of them, wee may performe them with all cheerefulneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. And finally we muſt continually craue the aſſiſtance of Gods gracious ſpirit, that thereby we may be in ſome good meaſure enabled to performe them ſo, as that they may be acceptable to God, and profitable for our owne ſaluation. </p>

                     </gap> duties.</note> Thus alſo when wee haue in the regenerate part an earneſt deſire to embrace vertue and to bee inriched with ſauing graces, like a cunning ſorcereſſe it laboureth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

Thus if wee be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout and earneſt in religion, it ſeeketh to taint vs with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip and ſuperſtition; if we excell in knowledge, it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to puffe vs vp with ſelfe-conceipt, to contemne plaine trueth, and curiouſly to affect nice and vnprofitable ſpeculations, and to deſpiſe others in compariſon of our ſelues whom wee thinke doe come ſhort of our meaſure. With our faith it intermingleth preſumption and carnall ſecuritie; which our loue, luſt and iealouſie; with our zeale, raſhneſſe and corrupt anger; with our humilitie baſeneſſe; with our courage audatiouſneſſe; with our conſtancy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy and obſtinate inflexibleneſſe; and finally with all our graces and excellent vertues pride and vaine glory, whereby wee ouerweene them, or arrogate the praiſe of them, or magnifie our ſelues before others who haue not attained to our pitch and proportion. And thus this cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning coyner embaſes the pure mettall of grace and vertue, by mixing with it the copper or rather droſſe of carnall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, ſetting notwithſtanding vpon it vertues ſtampe and ſuperſcription, that ſo it may goe for currant with vs, and by mingling theſe poyſons with our holeſome food, doeth make it become vnto vs mortall and pernitious. For preuenting of which deceipt we are often to examine our vertues, and to try if they be not tainted and infected with the contagion of the next extreames; let vs often bring them to the touchſtone of Gods trueth, which is onely ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make vs diſcerne the differences betweene the pure gold of Gods graces, and the baſe mettals of our own corruptions; &amp; let vs continually deſire the helpe of Gods holy ſpirit, which is that heauenly fire, that can part and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ſolid ſubſtance from the droſſe, purifying he on, and conſuming the other, and the pure gold from other baſe metalles of any kinde.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:10733:93"/> are thoſe, whereby it ſeeketh to alienate our hearts and affections from imbracing and practiſing of holy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Chriſtian actions. And firſt of all, if it cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs wholly to forſake them, &amp; at once to deſiſt from the exerciſe of them; then it will allure vs to abate our feruour and zeale in piety, to intermit all vertuous actions for a little while, and not to fall altogether, but in ſome degrees from our former ſinceritie, either pretending that if we goe more ſlowly, we ſhall goe more ſurely or that we are more zealous then needs, ſeeing with faire leſſe ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in our courſes wee may attaine vnto happineſſe; or elſe though vpon ſome occaſions we ſlacken our pace in the waies of godlineſſe for a while, we may hereafter make more ſpeed and eaſily recouer and redeeme our loſt time, by our future diligence. With which deceipt that we may not be ouertaken let vs conſider that there is no ſtanding ſtill in the Chriſtian courſe, ſeeing he who doth not dayly goe forward in it will queſtionleſſe goe backward; and what then can become of them who are in the way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and backſliding? That if we giue way to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemies for a time, and be perſwaded to lay aſide our Chriſtian armour, they will giue vnto vs deadly wounds before we ſhall be able to put it on againe, and that we may much more eaſily keepe them out of the gates of our city, then driue them backe when they are once entred. Let vs know that if we ſlacken our hold, we ſhall hardly recouer it in our fall; and that we may be as deſperately endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a lingring conſumption of grace and goodnes, as by a feuer of Apoſtacie. Let vs remember that if our heate come once to lukewarmeneſſe, it will within a while turne to keycoldnes, and that if the Diuell and our owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption can but a little while diſacquaint our hearts from God and his waies, they will not leaue till they haue made them meere ſtrangers, if they haue a little looſened them from him they will with much more eaſe pull them quite aſunder. And therefore let vs carefully watch ouer our ſelues, that there bee no declination in grace nor the leaſt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:10733:94"/> backſliding from our former ſinceritie, but <hi>forgetting that which is behinde, let vs reach vnto thoſe things which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and preſſe hard towards the marke, for the price of the high</hi>

And by our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence we ſhall looſe our ſweet communion with God, the light of his countenance, the ſenſe of his loue, and ioy and comfort of his ſpirit, which are our chiefe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements that make vs goe on in the way of godlines.

Which that we may defeate, let vs conſider, that though it vvere true, yet it is of no force to make vs leaue off or intermit our vertuous actions. For what ingratitude and groſſe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence were this in a ſeruant, who hauing done a little worke would loyter and ſurceaſe his paines, becauſe he is aſſured that his Lord is ſo bountifull, that hee would not hold backe any part of his wages? And how much more in vs ſeeing the riches of our reward is ſo ineſtimable and permanent, that we haue iuſt cauſe to thinke our whole life, which is but ſhort and momentanie to bee too too little (though we could attaine to the age of <hi>Methuſelah)</hi> if it were ſolye imployed in glorifying our gracious God by our faithfull ſeruice, which if we doe not, but content our ſelues onely with that which ſtandeth vpon the neceſſitie of our ſaluation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we plainely ſhew, that all we haue done is but falſe and counterfeit obedience, ſeeing it did ſpring and flow onely from fooliſh ſelfe-loue, and not from the ſincere loue of God. Fooliſh I ſay becauſe it ſhall ſurely

But be it that thou art not ſo ambitious of bleſſednes, but that the leaſt part and loweſt place will well content thee, conſider in the next place, that in this life wee are neuer ſo rich in grace and the fruits of obedience, that we may now giue ouer and ſpend vpon the ſtocke, vnleſſe wee meane to be bankerupts in goodnes; for if there be not a growth there will be a decreaſe, if not a progreſſe, then a regreſſe in the wayes of godlineſſe, and when we neglect the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, then doe we begin to ſerue the Diuell, the world and our owne fleſh. Beſides true ſauing grace is not like the Moone ſometime in the full and ſometime in the waine, but like the light of the morning which ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth till it be perfect day; It is alwayes in the growth vntill we come vnto a perfect age in Chriſt, which perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we ſhall not attaine vnto till wee haue layed downe <note place="margin">Pro. 4. 18.</note> theſe bodies of fleſh. And that which a while groweth and <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 6.</note> then ſtandeth at a ſtay, was but a falſe conception, and like an Embrio in the wombe, which though it may delude a woman with a deceiuing hope, yet this ioy will bring bitter <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 13.</note> ſorrow without all comfort in the end. Againe conſider, that all Gods promiſes are made to thoſe alone who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 10. &amp; 3. 21.</note> conſtant in their faith and obedience to the end. <hi>Hee that indureth to the end ſhall be ſaued,</hi> and be <hi>faithfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

And as the tree falleth ſo ſhall it lye.</hi> And therefore our former graces and good workes ſhould not make vs ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſluggiſh for the time to come, but much more painefull and diligent in imbracing and practiſing them, ſeeing if we now deſiſt we ſhall ſurely looſe all our former labour. Finally what ſouldiour will thus fooliſhly reaſon; I haue fought long and indured many brunts in the battell,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:10733:95"/> and now I will take my eaſe, becauſe I haue almoſt obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the victory, what traueller will ſit downe in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of his iourney, becauſe hee hath gone farre and taken much paines, ſeeing all his labour is loſt if he come not to the end? And who running in a race will giue ouer before he come to the goale, excuſing himſelfe that he hath runne well in the beginning; becauſe he is ſure to looſe the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with all his former paines? Yea rather becauſe they haue begunne well they will continue till by their conſtant labours they haue obtained their reward. And therefore let vs not be leſſe wiſe or induſtrious for the aſſured gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of heauenly and euerlaſting happineſſe, then we are for the momentany and vncertaine poſſeſſion of earthly trifles; but after we haue done much good, let vs ſtill hold on to doe more, <hi>for bleſſed is the ſeruant</hi> (not who hath done well in former times but) <hi>who when his maſter commeth ſhall be found ſo doing.</hi>

And theſe are principally two; the firſt is, that this enemy is not farre off, whereby we might haue leyſure and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of fitting and preparing our ſelues againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, before he could approch vnto vs, but dwelleth with vs, yea in vs. He is not onely neere at hand, and (as it were) in the Suburbs, cloſe vnto the gate of our ſoules, but it lodgeth euen within the walles of the Citie, not in the out-parts and backe lanes, but it keepeth ſtrong poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:10733:95"/> in the chiefe forts and caſtle of our mindes &amp; wils, our hearts and affections, where our chiefe ſtrength and <note place="margin">Ipſi geſtamus laqueum no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtrum nobiſcum circumferimus inimicum. <hi>Bernard.</hi> de Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drageſ. ſerm. 5.</note> treaſure lyeth. <hi>And</hi> (as one ſaith) <hi>wee beare our ſnare with vs, and carry our enemy about vs whether ſo euer we goe.</hi> The which danger is much aggrauated in that he doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his emnity, but is in outward ſhew a familiar friend vvho eateth, drinketh and ſleepeth with vs; it maketh ſhew of loue, but indeede mortally hateth vs, it is like an helper, but is in truth our greateſt Aduerſarie, and like <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah</hi> it offereth his paines in building the wals of our Citie, which may repulſe forraigne forces, when as it intendeth nothing but our ruine and to betray vs into the power of outward enemies. For no ſooner doth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and the world beſiege and aſſault vs with their tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but preſently it ioyneth with them, and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all our counſailes, it reuealeth vnto them our ſecrets, euen our hidden thoughts and vnknowne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and like a wicked <hi>Dalilah,</hi> hauing by treacherous flattery vndermined vs, it diſcouereth to theſe curſed Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims where our chiefe ſtrength lyeth; yea it ſecretly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth the gates of our hearts, and not onely letteth in all their forces, but as ſoone as they are entred ioyneth with them, and laying violent hands on the ſpirituall man, it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth all it may to captiuate and deſtroy him. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wilye red Dragon neuer maketh warre againſt vs, vntill he be aſſured firſt of theſe inbred traytors and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <note place="margin">Hic eſt qui ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus noſtras pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prio cuigulo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligat et baculo noſtro nos cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit Bernard. ibid.</note> aydes; And as one ſaith, <hi>it is his policie to binde vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with our owne girdle, and to ouercome and beat vs with our owne ſtaffe.</hi> Yea not onely doth the fleſh dwell and co-inhabite with vs, but it alſo adhereth and inſeparably clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto vs, as being a part, and the greater part of our ſelues. Whereby the dangerouſnes of this enemy appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, for the warre which it maketh againſt the new and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall man, is not onely ciuill and domeſticall (which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is much more perilous and terrible then that which is forraigne) but without any metaphor, properly, and truely inteſtine, and (as it were) in our owne bowels.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:10733:96"/> Beſides this combate betweene them is fought in a place of great diſaduantage, namely this world where the worſer <note place="margin">Brande quidem periculum eſt et grauis lucta ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſus domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum hoſtem &amp;c <hi>Bernard.</hi> de Quadri. ſerm. 5.</note> parts hath many friends and ſtrong aydes, euen millions of wicked men and whole legions of Diuels, and contrariwiſe the better part hath few friends and many enemies. <hi>Great ſurely</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>is the danger, and the conflict ſore and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous againſt an enemie ſo domeſtique, eſpecially ſeeing wee are ſtrangers and he a citizen; hee inhabiteth his owne countrey, and we here are exiles and ſtrangers.</hi> Yea in truth this warre is more inteſtiue then that vvhich was betweene <hi>Rebecca</hi> her twins. For not onely doth here one perſon fight againſt another, nor (as ſome would haue it) the body againſt the ſoule of the ſame man, nor yet one faculty alone againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of a different nature, the ſenſitiue againſt the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and the will &amp; affections againſt the iudgement and conſcience; but alſo the ſelfe-ſame faculties againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, reaſon againſt reaſon, will againſt will, the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection againſt the ſame, loue againſt loue, feare againſt feare, and hope againſt hope. In which reſpect this fight with our fleſh is much more dangerous then our fight with Sathan himſelfe; for though hee be ſometime yea often neere vs, yet not alwaies, and when he is neereſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee is not alike neere as our owne fleſh, which adhereth to euery part and faculty of body and ſoule. Though he caſteth into our hearts and mindes the fiery darts of his tentations, yet if we catch them vpon, and quench them with the ſhield of faith they will not hurt vs. Yea though he buckle and cloſe with vs, yet if the Spirit of God dwelling in vs reſiſt this foule ſpirit, he will flie away at leaſt for a ſeaſon, and wee <note place="margin">Luk. 4. 13.</note> ſhall be rid of his noyſome company; but our fleſh and carnall corruptions inſeparably cleaue vnto vs, and though they be neuer ſo often ouercome, by faſting, prayer, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſuch like ſpirituall exerciſes, yet as long as we liue, we cannot be quite rid of them, nor wholly ſubdue them, and an hilate their ſtrength, but after they ſeeme to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered they will againe flouriſh, after they are weakened they will recouer ſtrength, after they ſeeme to languiſh
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10733:96"/> with age, they will regaine their youthfull vigour, yea when in outward ſhew they appeare mortified and quite dead, they will againe reuiue and ſtanding ſtoutly in their ſtrength they will re<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>enforce the fight againſt vs.</p>

That the daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſnes of this enemie is much increaſed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.</note> From whence it may plainely appeare, how exceeding dangerous the fleſh with the luſts thereof are vnto vs, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are enemies not onely ſtrong and ſubtle, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hard at hand, not onely beſieging and beſetting vs, but euen dwelling with and in vs. Whereby they haue no ſmall aduantage againſt vs, for neuer leauing but adhering and cleauing vnto vs in all places and at all times, they are ready to vvatch all occaſions and to take all opportunities of doing vs miſchiefe, laying traps and ſnares for vs in all our enterpriſes. For doe vve vndertake the performance of holy and religious duties? Why then they dogge and follow vs to the exerciſes, and diſtract vs with vvorldly cogitations and wandring thoughts, and oppreſſe our mindes with dulneſſe, drowſineſſe and carnall wearineſſe.

For if our ſinnefull fleſh be neuer weary in running ſuch courſes

Neither let

And therefore let vs make this vſe of the rage of the fleſh, to be moued thereby to vnite our forces and redouble our blowes, and then though it make neuer ſo many gallant brauadoes, it will quickly yeelde and we ſhall be ſure of an happy victory.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:10733:100"/> of Scripture, for the Apoſtle telleth vs, that <hi>the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and that theſe are contrary the one to the other, ſo that we cannot doe the things we would.</hi> Where by fleſh and ſpirit (as I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) we cannot vnderſtand the body and ſoule but the part <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> regenerate and vnregenerate, the corruption of nature and the qualitie of holineſſe in euery faculty and power of them both. So in his owne example hee ſheweth the practique and experience of this trueth in the ſeauenth chapter of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> for he profeſſeth that he <hi>could not doe the good hee</hi>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">§ Sect 2. Of the firſt and cheife cauſe of the conflict which is Gods will for the manifeſtation of his owne glory.</note> The cauſes of this conflict are either efficient and more remote, or formall and eſſentiall; the later is plainely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, the former implyed in the deſcription of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, namely Gods will appointing this fight; and to this purpoſe, not perfecting our ſanctification in this life, but in part regenerating, and in part leauing vs vnregenerate. Yea but why did not the Lord, who through his infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was as able to haue recreated and renewed vs at once by his ſole word as he did firſt create &amp; make, vs perfect this worke of regeneration, repleniſh vs with abundance of his ſpirit and with ſanctifying graces thereof, and quite aboliſh the fleſh with the luſtes thereof? I anſwere though there were no other reaſon but the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his moſt wiſe will, it were ſufficient to ſatisfie vs, for hee beſt knoweth what to giue, and when to giue
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:10733:103"/> it, what meaſure of his grace is fitteſt for him to beſtowe, and the moſt ſeaſonable time for vs to receiue it. But yet diuers reaſons may bee yeelded why the Lord ſuffereth the fleſh and the ſinfull luſtes thereof ſtill in ſome meaſure and degree to remaine in vs, and to fight with and aſſault the ſpirituall part, all which may be reduced to two heads; firſt becauſe this courſe is moſt profitable, and ſecondly moſt fitting and ſeaſonable. It is moſt profitable both for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of Gods glory, and the aduancing and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our owne good. It doeth more manifeſt and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the glory of God, for the weaker vvee are in our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate part, and the ſtronger the fleſh is with all other the enemies of our ſaluation, the more clearely his wiſedome and power ſhineth and appeareth, which ſo ſtrengtheneth this weake part, that it is able to ſtand in the day of battell; yea that it obtaineth a full and finall victory, and putteth all it mighty enemies to flight. Whereas if we were perfectly regenerate and the fleſh vtterly vanquiſhed and aboliſhed, it were no great wonder, that we were not ouercome, if we had no enemy or but a vveake one to ſet vpon vs. And this moued the Lord to ſuffer <hi>the pricke in the fleſh</hi> to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the Apoſtle, and the <hi>meſſenger of Sathan</hi> to buffet him, notwithſtanding he ſo earneſtly prayed to be deliuered from <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note> them, that the al-ſufficiency of his grace aſſiſting him might appeare, and his power might bee gloriouſly manifeſted in his vveakeneſſe and infirmitie. Secondly God is more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, when as vvee ſeeing the ſtrength of our fleſh and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall corruptions, and our frailtie and vveakeneſſe, vvants and many infirmities of our ſpirituall part are moued here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to attribute the vvhole glory and prayſe of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the alone mercy of God, both in reſpect of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and perſecting thereof, and vtterly denying our ſelues and our owne righteouſneſſe, doe wholly reſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the perfect and al-ſufficient righteouſneſſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt: where as if there were in vs perfection in holineſſe, vvee vvould hardly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Lord to be all in all in the worke of our ſaluation,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:10733:104"/> but would bee ready to attribute ſomething vnto our ſelues. Thirdly, the wiſedome and power of God is more manifeſted and glorified, when as he doth his great works by contrary meanes and cauſes which in their owne nature would rather hinder them. And therefore hee will haue vs <note place="margin">Ioh. 9. 41. 1 Cor. 3. 18. Apoc. 3. 18. 2 Cor. 12. 9.</note> blinde that we may ſee, fooliſh that we may become wiſe, poore that he may inrich vs, weake that we may be ſtrong, imperfect in our graces, that wee may bee endued with more perfection, and finally will haue vs paſſe by the gates of hell, that we may come to a greater meaſure of heauenly happineſſe.

And what is the fleſh, but the defacing of this image, the depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of this originall righteouſneſſe, and the ſtaine of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall corruption which hath ouerſpread and defiled all the powers and parts of our ſoules and body? ſo that the fleſh reſiſteth the ſpirit in a double oppoſition, both as it is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation

The other is their cohabitation and dwelling together in the ſame place and ſubiect, which miniſtreth vnto them mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally occaſion, and impoſeth a neceſſity of their continuall oppoſition, euen as when fire and water, heate and colde meete together, there can neuer bee any agreement, or ſo much as a truce till the one of them haue gotten the vpper hand, and the other as much as lyeth in the power of the contrary quality, be ſubdued and aboliſhed.</p>

More plainely, the fleſh doeth not onely dwell in the body or inferiour and ſenſuall parts; and the ſpirit in the ſoule alone, or the intellectuall and reaſonable faculties, for ſo they might part their bounds &amp; dominions, ſhut the doore againſt one another, and ſometime enioy a peace or truce without the others moleſtation; but in the ſame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding &amp; will, body and affections, ſo that the whole ſoule in reſpect of it diuers faculties, is partly fleſh and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit, and cannot bee deuided but onely diſtinguiſhed, the vnderſtanding, will, affections and body being partly regenerate &amp; partly vnregenerate, partly ſanctified by Gods ſpirit, and partly ſinnefull and corrupted with thoſe reliques of ſinne remaining in them. For example the image of God is in part renewed, and the image of ſinne and Sathan in part remaineth.

Thereby is diſcouered vnto vs the tyranny of the diuell, whereby he raigneth and rageth in vs, working our hearts to his will, and inclyning vs to drudge in his ſeruice, for no other reward but the vncertaine pay of worldly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which ſhall be accompanied with endleſſe deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the vglineſſe and intollerable waight of ſinne which as an heauy burthen preſſeth vs downe to hell, the terrible wrath of God inflamed againſt vs by our ſinnes, and the curſe of the lawe ready to attach vs. Finally that our liues be momentary and vncertaine, and therefore alſo the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

Then there <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 6.</note> is wrought in his will a firme reſolution to chuſe Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for his Sauiour, and to reſt and relye vpon him onely for his ſaluation, which is the ſecond degree of true faith,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:10733:123"/> vnto which when the Chriſtian hath attained by the liuely ſenſe &amp; experimentiall feeling of Gods loue in his holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the vertue and power of Chriſts death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection for the mortifying of his ſinnes, and the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and quickening of him in all ſauing graces, and finally by his daily walking with God in the workes of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, and that ſweete communion which he hath with him in ſpirituall exerciſes, he groweth from one degree of faith to another, till at laſt there bee wrought in the minde not onely a certaine, but alſo a full perſwaſion of Gods loue, the remiſſion of his ſinnes and his owne ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But yet the fleſh and reliques of corruption remaining in vs, when wee haue attained vnto the greateſt perfection which this life yeeldeth, as in the part regenerate, there is full and certaine perſwaſion, ſo in the vnregenerate part dwelleth doubting, infidelitie &amp; vaine preſumption, which continually aſſault one another, and ſometimes the one, ſometimes the other preuaileth and getteth the better in the particular skirmiſh, although in the concluſion &amp; ende of the fight, faith alwayes ouercommeth and a obtaineth a full and finall victory. In the meane time, euen after that by faith wee haue laide hold on the promiſes, and haue growne to a great meaſure of ſtrength and to an high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perſwaſion, doubting and infidelitie taking the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of ſome grieuous temptation, doe giue vnto our faith many wounds and foyles, of which notwithſtanding it recouereth vpon the renewing of our couenant with God, receiuing the Sacrament which is the ſeale of it, the applying afreſh of Gods gracious promiſes, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his former mercies, and the renewing of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, eſpecially for our latter ſlippes and fall. And this <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 11.

Whereby it appeareth that there is in euery man regenerate a notable conflict between faith and vnbeliefe, whereof it commeth to paſſe, that Gods deareſt children may oftentimes not onely be foyled with diffidence and doubting, but alſo in ſome grieuous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations may fall into ſome deſpaire of Gods mercie and loue towards them; the which notwithſtanding differeth from that deſpaire which is in the wicked and reprobate, in that theirs is totall and finall, whereas the faithfull lye in it onely for a time, whileſt the violence of the temptation preſſed vpon them by the diuel and the fleſh laſt, and is not totall, ſeeing their faith euen in the greateſt brunt fighteth and ſtriueth againſt it, and in the ende getteth the vpper hand.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next point to be conſidered in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit, is the ſubiect of it where and in whom it is fought; The which is ſuch perſons as are regenerate, and the faithfull onely, whileſt they liue in the world: for in them onely is the cauſe of this conflict, which is the cohabitation of theſe enemies which aſſault and reſiſt one another. Neither can there be any ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in the glorified Saints, becauſe they are perfectly ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and haue no reliques of the fleſh or ſinnefull corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on remaining in them, and conſequently no enemy to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſiſt the ſpirit. For whereas it may bee obiected that there was a conflict in our Sauiour who was perfectly
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:10733:129"/> holy, when being in his agony hee prayed to haue the cup paſſe from him and then ſubmitted his will to his fathers, <hi>Not my will but thine be done;</hi> To this I anſwere, that this <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 42.</note> was not the conflict berweene the fleſh and the ſpirit; but as the Schoolemen ſpeake betweene two willes in Chriſt, the ſuperiour and the inferiour, or the will of reaſon, and the will of ſenſuality, the one being the will of the fleſh or naturall appetite and concupiſcence, the other the will <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 13.</note> of the man or the reaſonable creature, as the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> ſeemeth to diſtinguiſh them. Thus the Diſciples hauing long watched, by their inferiour will and ſenſuall appetite deſired ſleepe; But the will of reaſon ſhould haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled this, and therefore becauſe it did not, our Sauiour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth them, <hi>Could you not watch with me one hower.</hi> So <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 42.</note> a man may by his inferiour will deſire to eate and drinke, and in his ſuperiour will may deſire rather to abſtaine, that it may be conformable to Gods reuealed will, requiring that wee ſhould humble our ſelues by faſting and prayer. So when death approacheth a man may in his inferiour will and naturall appetite, deſire to liue, and yet in his reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable will ſubmit himſelfe to Gods good pleaſure. Yea de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in many reſpects to be diſſolued and to be with Chriſt. And thus our Sauiour being man and in all things like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, ſinne onely excepted, deſired that the cuppe of his paſſion might paſſe from him in his inferiour will and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall appetite, which ſhunneth death and ſeeketh the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of it ſelfe; but in his reaſonable will conſidering the ende why he came into the world, which was by his death to glorifie God in perfecting the worke of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, he ouerruled the naturall appetite &amp; did wholly ſubmit himſelfe to the wil of his father. Neither is the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall will ſinnefull &amp; vnlawfull, when it is ſubiected to the reaſonable, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it goeth about of a ſubiect to become a Soueraigne, and to reſiſt and ouerrule that vnto which it ſhould yeeld obedience. Euen as it is no fault in a ſubiect to deſire that his owne will in things lawfull or indifferent may be done, ſo that when hearing the contrary pleaſure
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:10733:130"/> of his Prince he doe not rebell againſt it, but is content wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to ſubmit himſelfe vnto it. Or if wee would haue this ſtrife and conflict to be in the ſame will of Chriſt, wee may ſay that it was a combate, not betweene grace and corruption, but betweene diuers deſires in the ſame will, which may lawfully be in a man, if they be grounded on diuers reſpects; as a man may at the ſame time lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to liue, that hee may glorifie God, or to dye, that hee may ceaſe to ſinne &amp; be glorified by him; he may deſire to eate, for the refreſhing of nature and the repelling of the paine of hunger, and to faſt that he may be fitted the better for ſome religious exerciſe. And ſo our Sauiour deſired to haue the cuppe paſſe from him, hauing reſpect to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of his nature, and at the ſame time was willing to die, that he might yeelde obedience to his fathers will, and perfect the worke of our redemption; and yet as one ſaith, <hi>Vtrobique Chriſtus neutrobique peccatum, Chriſt in both, but ſinne in neither.</hi>

That the conflict that is in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate &amp; that which is in the vnregenerate differ much, and firſt in their grounds &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from which they ariſe.</note> Howbeit we are to knowe, that there is euen in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man another fight and skirmiſh, which hauing ſome ſeeming ſhewe and ſimilitude of the ſpirituall conflict, is by worldly and ciuill men miſtaken for it; in which reſpect it wil not be amiſſe to diſtinguiſh them one from another. Firſt then they differ in their ground and cauſe from which they ariſe; for whereas (as hath beene ſhewed) the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conflict ariſeth from the grace of regeneration and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, whereby the gifts and graces of Gods ſpirit, being infuſed into all our powers and faculties, doe make warre againſt our carnall corruptions and fleſhly luſts; the conflict which is in the vnregenerate, ariſeth from thoſe reliques of Gods image defaced in vs, oppoſing the image of Sathan and our ſinnefull corruption. For the minde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth ſome ſmall ſparkes of the light of nature, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine common notions, which receiue ſome litle ſtrength and luſter from the view and ſtudy in the booke of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and yet a larger increaſe of illumination from the

With which light of the vnderſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience being directed, it retaineth alſo a power to excuſe vs when we doe well, and to accuſe, condemne, terrifie and torment vs when we doe euill. So the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that the Gentiles who had not the lawe, did ſhewe the worke of the lawe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2: 15.</note> 
                  <hi>written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witnes, and their thoughts the meane while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi> The will likewiſe retaineth a kinde of freedome, not onely about things materially euill, but alſo ſuch as are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, ciuill &amp; meerely morall, though herein alſo it be very weake, corrupt and defectiue. And theſe reliques are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men, and in ſome are much encreaſed, and riſe to a farre higher pitch and degree, by the common guifts of the ſpirit and meere ciuill graces, which in a farre greater meaſure are conferred vpon ſome men, then vpon others. But there being mingled in all theſe faculties a ſea of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, with ſome ſmall droppes of thoſe created reliques, ioyned with a world of wickedneſſe in the inferiour and ſenſuall faculties of the ſoule; and many of theſe carnal corruptions being in their ſpeciall kindes contrary one to another (although they generally agree in being all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and euill) from hence ariſeth this warre and diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, like vnto theeues and robbers, who all agree together in robbing and ſpoyling of a true man, but fall out among themſelues when they come to deuide the prey. Thus the vnderſtanding by the light of nature or common grace diſcerning in particular actions what is good &amp; to be embraced and what is euil to be ſhunned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth the conſcience accordingly, and leaueth it to it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For example, the vnderſtanding diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that it is grounded on reaſon and equirie, that we ſhould ſerue God who created vs, &amp; doeth continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue vs, according to that of the Apoſtle; <hi>For we are his</hi>

So the vnderſtanding diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Gods excellency, goodneſſe and perfection, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this to the conſcience, that God aboue all is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and loued, the which light when it hath receiued from the vnderſtanding, it accuſeth and condemneth vs when we loue or reuerence any thing more then him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning vs as guilty of ſinne and liable to fearefull puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; wherewith the heart being affrighted and terrified, it is caſt downe with griefe and ſadneſſe, and oftentimes plunged into vtter deſpaire. But when the vnderſtanding and conſcience through the light of nature, helped and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the Scriptures, haue thus in ſome poore ſort and ſmall degree performed their dutie, the will being peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the baites of worldly vanities, doeth riſe vp in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen rebellion againſt the vnderſtanding and conſcience, and though it acknowledgeth the trueth of their propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and concluſions, yet it commeth in with a <hi>non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante,</hi> and reſolueth notwithſtanding they perſwade to the contrary, that it will doe what it liſt, and goe on in it owne courſe, though it bee conuinced to be the worſt, becauſe howſoeuer it hazardeth the ſoule for the time to come to the loſſe of heauen and the torments of hell, yet it bringeth the preſent fruition of earthly vanities. And no ſooner
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:10733:132"/> is reaſon and conſcience ready to ſubdue the rebellion of the will and to perſwade by other arguments vnto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but preſently a tumultuous route of vnruly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and raging paſſions, come to reſcue and ſtrengthen the will in it rebellion by preſenting vnto it the honours, riches and pleaſures of the world, which it may gaine by following wicked courſes; and if the reaſon &amp; conſcience oppoſe future daungers and would hinder the willes euill choyſe by further perſwaſions, they ſtoppe the mouth of reaſon with tumultuous rage, and with loud ſhowting and clamorous cryes drowne the voyce of the conſcience, that they are conſtrained to ceaſe directing and accuſing, or to continue doing it in vaine and to no purpoſe. An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whereof wee haue in <hi>Laban;</hi> for though reaſon and conſcience told him, that hee ought to vſe <hi>Iacob</hi> well, and richly to reward his ſeruice becauſe God bleſſed all he had for his ſake, yet his will being corrupted and his heart and affections being wholly caried away with worldly wealth, he oppreſſeth and wrongeth him with one iniury after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. So though reaſon and conſcience told <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that he did wickedly in diſobeying Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements and keeping backe his people from ſeruing of him, which made him ſometime, when hee was on the racke of ſome preſent iudgement, to confeſſe that he had ſinned, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards his heart was hardened, his will rebelled, and his affections being ſet vpon the profite of their ſeruice, did ſtoppe his eares to all perſwaſions, and to the accuſations of his owne conſcience. Thus <hi>Saule</hi> in his vnderſtanding <note place="margin">Exod. 9. 27. 34.</note> conceiued that <hi>Dauid</hi> was innocent; and therefore his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience accuſing him that hee did wickedly in perſuing him, made him to iuſtifie him, and to condeme his owne vniuſtice and faultineſſe; <hi>Thou art more righteous then I,</hi>

                  <hi>for thou haſt rewarded me good, whereas I haue rewarded thee euill;</hi> but by and by his will and affections being wholly ſet vpon worldly honour, and tranſported with ambition, he hearkeneth neither to reaſon nor conſcience, but perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth him againe with more then wonted rage. Finally,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:10733:132"/> thus then <hi>Pilate,</hi> aduiſed by reaſon and conſcience, iuſtified our Sauiour as innocent and faultleſſe, his will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons chiefely deſiring to continue his eſteeme with <hi>Caſar,</hi> and to be applauded by the Prieſtes, Phariſces and vulgar multitude; he reuerſeth the ſentence of reaſon and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and vniuſtly condemneth the innocent to dye with malefactours. </p>

The ſecond diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in the mouing cauſes of theſe conflicts.</note> Secondly the conflict betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit, differeth from that which is betweene the reaſon and will, the conſcience and affections in the mouing cauſes, for the ſpirit is moued to aſſault the fleſh by the true loue of God, which cauſeth it to make warre againſt carnall luſtes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are odious vnto him, as being enemies to his grace, and contrary to his holy will; and by a filiall feare of his Maieſtie which maketh the man regenerate loath to yeelde vnto any motions of ſin, leaſt he ſhould hereby of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and diſpleaſe him; but the combate betweene the conſcience and affections ariſeth from ſelfe-loue and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile feare, which make the man vnregenerate to withſtand the motions of ſinne in the will and affections for feare of thoſe puniſhments, which will accompany his ſinnes, as horrour of conſcience, ſhame, corporall paine, eternall death and helliſh condemnation, like the ſlaue who dare not offend his maiſter, not becauſe diſliketh the fault, but becauſe he feareth the whip; or the thiefe who is reſtrained from robbing, not in obedience to the lawe or becauſe he hateth ſinne or loueth iuſtice and trueth, but becauſe hee feareth to be hanged on the gallowes. And ſo likewiſe they differ in their endes, for the ende at which the regenerate man aymeth in fighting againſt the fleſh, is that hee may glorifie God in his victory ouer his ſinnefull luſtes and be more and more aſſured of his loue and his owne ſaluation; but the ende at which the conſcience of the man vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate aymeth in oppoſing his corrupt will and earnall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is that hee may the better compaſſe his worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, either in the obtaining of ſome earthly good, or the anoyding and eſcaping of ſome imminent euill.

And here all the powers and faculties of the whole man as they remaine vnregenerate, doe with vnited forces fight againſt the ſpirit, the reaſon, minde and conſcience not excepted. But in the combate which is in the vnregenerate, the conflict is betweene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers faculties, which are all carnall and corrupted, fighting one of them againſt another, as betweene the reaſon and the will, the conſcience and the carnall concupiſcence, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 15.</note> and affections; in which whether ſoeuer party preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſtill the vnſanctified man is drawne vnto ſinne. And ſo alſo they differ in the manner of the fight, for that which is betweene the ſpirit and the fleſh is done by contrary lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the one againſt the other in a practicall reall and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall maner; but that which is betweene the reaſon and the will, the conſcience and the affections, is maintained by logicall diſputes, and mentall diſcourſes, whileſt the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence inferres fearefull concluſions of puniſhments &amp; Gods enſuing iudgements vpon the wicked choyſe of the will,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:10733:133"/> and their yeelding to ſatisfie their carnall affections. For though in the creation the wil was in ſubiection to reaſon, and embraced or ſhunned that which it approued or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and though this order bee commonly obſerued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the faculties, euen in this ſtate of corrupion; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that man rebelled againſt his chiefe Soueraigne, there followed rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therupon in the inferior faculties againſt their ſuperiour in the little commonwealth of man; and now the will yeelding obedience no further then it liketh and luſteth, doeth often reſiſt reaſon which is his King, and refuſeth to follow it directions, and to allow of it concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but rather embraceth the cleane contrary. Now whileſt reaſon is earneſt in perſwading by arguments, and the will rebellious and violent in croſſing and thawarting it, the conſcience being awakened and rowſed vp, commeth in to the reſcue of reaſon, reſtraining the will from embracing that euill it liketh, by the terrours of puniſhment which it adiudgeth the offender vnto, vpon the committing of the ſinne: wherewith oftentimes when the violence of the will is abated and the courage thereof cooled, ſo that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to ſtagger and faint in its reſolution, then enters in a tumultuous troope of paſſions and affections, as freſh aydes to ſtrengthen the will in rebellion, which being themſelues firſt hyred and corrupted to doe ſeruice vnto Sathan in ſinnefull deſires and actions, with the preſent pay or expected wages of worldly vanities, doe by the ſame proffers perſwade the will to continue ſtiffe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate in rebellious courſes, and with all reſolution to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſelfe againſt reaſon and conſcience. But yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that in all this conflict betweene theſe diuers faculties, there is no enmitie &amp; contrariety betweene them in their natures, neither is there more grace or leſſe corruption in the reaſon and conſcience, then in the will and affections, for they as well as theſe doe like and loue ſinne with the pleaſures and profits of it in it owne nature, if they were not deterred with the fearefull conſequents of Gods iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and puniſhments, which they ſee will neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:10733:134"/> vpon ſuch ſinnefull praemiſes.

Whereof it is that a new borne babe in Chriſt who hath litle learning, and a ſmall degree of knowledge and ſpirituall vnderſtanding, doeth with as great reſolution withſtand the encounters and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſinne, and endeauours to pleaſe God though he be ſcarce able to render a reaſon of his doings, as thoſe who are growne vnto a riper age, and haue attained vnto an higher degree of learning and wiſedome. An example whereof wee haue in many poore, ſimple &amp; illiterate men, who as conſcionably auoide all ſin, and practiſe the holy duties of a Chriſtian life, as other Chriſt ans who are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and haue a greater meaſure of knowledge and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and alſo in many martyres, who being vnlearned and not able to maintaine the trueth of their cauſe by ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſticall diſputes, did yet as reſolutly oppoſe themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt idolatry and popiſh hereſies, and as willingly and couragiouſly ſeale the trueth with their blood, as others who had attained to the greateſt learning. Which plainely ſheweth that their oppoſition to errour and falſehood, was not chiefly grounded on mentall diſcourſes (for then thoſe who moſt excelled in learning &amp; knowledge ſhould haue as much exceeded in their reſolution and oppoſition) but vpon that ſecret change of nature, made in them by Gods ſpirit, by which they oppoſed that which was euil, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their reaſon and vnderſtanding, but alſo in their will, hearts and affections, with all other powers and parts of their ſoules and bodies. By which it appeareth that the Chriſtian is no ſooner conceiued of the ſeede of the ſpirit, and by communication of ſauing grace, receiueth ſpirituall life, birth and being, but hee preſently becommeth one of Gods ſouldiars, and as naturally and voluntarily by vertue of his regeneration, fighteth againſt the fleſh, the world and the diuel, without any preſſing by the conſcience, or intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and enforcing by the terrours of the lawe denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing puniſhment, if hee goe not on this Warfare, onely out

Secondly, from the combate of the fleſh and ſpirit, vnſained repentance is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, or renewed and encreaſed in thoſe who are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate for there is a change in them, principally in their wils, hearts and affection, whereby in all things they oppoſe the fleſh, hating that which it loueth, and louing that which it hateth, willing what it nilleth, and nilling that which it willeth; vpon which followeth the purifying of the heart and the purging of it from all ſinfull corruptions, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and forſaking of all ſinne, and a hearty deſire and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt endeauour to ſerue the Lord in holineſſe and newnes of life, and not onely a reformation in part, but totall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in all our affections and actions, in the renouncing of all ſin: and the embracing of al good duties in the whole courſe of our liues.

For according as the meaſure of our ſpirituall ſtrength and riches of Gods grace, as alſo of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall corruption differ in reſpect of their diuers proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch is the difference in this Chriſtian combate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one faithfull man and another. For ſome receiue but a ſmall meaſure of ſpirituall illumination, the leaſt degrees of faith, confidence, loue and other ſpirituall graces; and theſe through their weakeneſſe, commonly make weake aſſaults againſt the fleſh and fleſhly luſts, and as weakely withſtand their encounters, whereof it commeth to paſſe
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:10733:143"/> that they ſtand in the battaile with much faintneſſe and frailetie, and receiue many wounds, foyles and fals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they obtaine the victory. Though the Lord performing euen to theſe his gracious promiſes, doth not ſuffer them to be tempted aboue their power, but either aſsiſteth them by his owne might, or fitteth them with ſlight tentations, according to their weakeneſſe. Sometimes there is in the regenerate leſſe reformation of their corrupt natures by the reſtraining grace of God and the common gifts of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by reaſon whereof the fleſh is of greater ſtrength and the corruptions thereof are much more malignant, raging and violent in all the faculties of their ſoules, eſpecially in their wils, paſsions and affections. So that though they haue a great meaſure of ſtrength and ſpirituall grace, yet they cannot with any eaſe, or in ſhort time get the vpper hand, but there is much ſtrugling and wraſtling, ſharpe and fierce aſſaults on both ſides, as is betweene mighty enemies equally matched, and ſometimes the one, ſometimes the other preuaileth, and woundeth and foyleth the aduerſe party; like thoſe warres of old betweene the Romanes and Carthaginians, and thoſe mighty enemies the Turkes and Perſians in theſe dayes. And becauſe both parties continue in their great ſtrength, hereof it commeth to paſſe, that theſe ſharpe and fierce encounters, doe alſo laſt euen to the end of their liues, vntill the Lord by death doe put an end to the battaile, giuing vnto the ſpirituall man full and finall victory ouer all his enemies, and the crowne of victory euerlaſting happineſſe.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">§ Sect. 4. That this conflict is aften weake in ſtrong Chriſtians</note> Finally the Lord to ſhew the riches of his bounty, doth ſometimes giue vnto his ſeruants ſuch a large meaſure of ſpirituall ſtrength, ſauing grace, knowledge, faith, loue, Chriſtian magnanimitie and the reſt, that like thoſe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie worthies in the time of <hi>Dauid,</hi> none of their ſpirituall enemies are able to withſtand them, but in the firſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters after this ſtrength receiued, they foile, wound, and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh them, either leading them captiue without any great reſiſtance, or elſe putting them to a ſhamefull flight. So as
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:10733:143"/> they neuer againe gather their ſcattered forces, nor once dare to enter the field; onely they may perhaps after a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous manner lye in ambuſhment, and make ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt vpon ſome great aduantage. And in this caſe the ſpirituall ſould our gloriouſly triumpheth ouer his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enemies, and keeping them vnder with vnreſiſtable power, doth enioy his victory with much peace and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly comfort. But all this while we are to remember that the Chriſtian Champian, and the Lords great worthy, doth not thus preuaile by vertue of any naturall ſtrength which he hath aboue others of his fellow ſouldiers, (but like <hi>Sampſon)</hi> through the gifts of the ſpirit, and the power of God communicated vnto him; which becauſe through their pride and ſelfe-loue they are apt to forget, and beeing ſwollen vp in their owne conceipts, to rob God of his glory, by arrogating ſome part of the praiſe of their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſtrength and victories vnto themſelues; the Lord lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them by ſpiritual deſertions vnto their owne abilities, and letteth looſe their enemies to aſſault and encounter them.

The which waighty que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion hath already in part beene reſolued, when as I ſhewed the differences betweene the combate of the fleſh and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the conflict of conſcience, and the will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and now commeth to be more fully and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:10733:144"/> handled. For the clearing whereof we need not to make any further ſearch, but onely to examine whether the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God accompanied with his ſauing graces which is one of the combatants doth reſide and dwell in vs. For if it doe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no queſtion but this conflict is in vs ſeeing it no ſooner entreth and taketh poſſeſſion of vs, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently it maketh warre againſt our fleſh with all the carnall luſts thereof, depoſeth them from their regency, giueth them deadly wounds, holdeth them in ſubiection, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth all it may, vtterly to deſplace and roote them out. Now euery faithfull man ought to be aſſured of this, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the ſpirit of God dwelleth in him; or if hee haue not this aſſurance as yet, he is neuer to be at reſt, till it bee euident and cleare in his owne heart and conſcience, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt queſtion, and the waightieſt and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant caſe of conſcience, that can bee propounded or knowne of vs. The which as it may bee knowne, ſo no Chriſtian ought to bee ignorant of it, as the Apoſtle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth by that interrogation: <hi>Know yee not that yee are the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 16. &amp; 6. 19.</note>

Secondly, if we doe not know that the Spirit dwelleth in vs, we cannot know that we haue any part in Chriſt; and conſequently, that we are true Chriſtians, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy Spirit is the principall bond of the vnion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and vs, by which he dwelleth in vs, and wee
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:10733:145"/> in him. Thirdly, if we doe not know that the Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs, we cannot know that wee are iuſtified; for wee haue nothing to doe with Chriſts righteouſneſſe in which we ſtand righteous before God, till by our ſpirituall vnion he is made ours, whereby we haue right and intereſt in all his benefits, wee cannot know that wee are adopted the children of God, vnleſſe we know that wee haue the <hi>ſpirit of Adoption,</hi> whereby <hi>wee cry in our hearts.

Fourthly, vnleſſe we know that wee haue the Spirit, wee <note place="margin">Ioh. 2. 20. 27.

Fiftly, if we be not aſſured that he is in vs, wee can haue no ſound comfort, becauſe hee is the onely true comforter, from whom all ſound comfort ſpringeth, and all other comforts of which he is not the author, are falſe, vngrounded and meere deluſions. Laſtly, wee muſt labour after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note> of the fruits of the ſpirit dwelling in vs, as that wee haue faith, and that Chriſt dwelleth in vs, and therefore we muſt alſo be aſſured that we haue the tree and roote, for the effect argueth his cauſe as well as the cauſe his effect, and not to know that wee haue the ſpirit, is not to know that we haue any grace.</p>

But the knowledge of the wicked is onely in theory and ſpeculation, whereby they are enabled onely to talke and diſcourſe of the things they conceiue, and haue no ſenſe, feeling or experience of that powerfull working of it for their inward ſanctification or outward reformation, but ſtill lye frozen in the dregs of their ſins, and neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcionably practiſe any duties, though they can learnedly and cloquently diſcourſe of them.

                  <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 6 7.</note> becauſe their knowledge is not ſetled and grounded vpon theſe onely true foundations which neuer faile. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the knowledge of the regenerate is more cleare di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and particular, and therefore ſufficient to direct and guide them, not onely after ſome generall manner, but alſo
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:10733:147"/> in all particular duties and actions; but the knowledge of the vnregenerate is more generall, confuſed and darke, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inabling them to ſet downe generall rules of duties, or if particular, yet rather to others then to themſelues, who are ſo blinded with their paſſions and carnall luſtes, that their knowledge giueth them no ſufficient direction for their owne cariage in particular duties. Thirdly the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the regenerate ſtill applieth the things knowne to particular vſe, bringing the word of God home to their owne hearts and conſciences; as the threatnings of the law for their humiliation to driue them to Chriſt, to reſtraine them from ſin, when they are ready to fal, and to raiſe them being fallen by vnfained repentance. So <hi>Iob</hi> kept his <hi>eyes</hi> vnder couenant, that they ſhould not <hi>glaunce wantonly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on women,</hi>

                  <hi>ſinne againſt God?</hi> And ſo likewiſe hereby they are inticed and ſpurred forward vnto all good duties, when as they feele themſelues dull and ſlow. For ſo the Apoſtle hauing ſpoken of Gods feareful iudgement he applieth this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5: 11.</note> to particular vſe; <hi>knowing therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Lord we perſwade men,</hi> as though hee ſhould ſay, I dare not knowing this terrible iudgement, but perſwade you to obedience and dehort you from ſinne, leaſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting my duty I alſo bee lyable vnto it. And thus alſo knowing the promiſes of the Goſpell, they apply them for their owne conſolation; according to that of the Apoſtle; <hi>Whatſoeuer things were written aforetime, were written for</hi>

                  <hi>our learning, that wee through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might haue hope.</hi> But the wicked by their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge apply not or miſapply, they either apply all vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or apply falſely vnto themſelues, arrogating all the promiſes of life and ſaluation, though they doe not all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto them. Fourthly, the knowledge of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate drawes them neerer vnto God, and vnites them more
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:10733:148"/> firmely vnto him in loue &amp; true obedience, firſt in loue of God and of that truth which he hath reuealed vnto them, for when he hath made knowne vnto them not onely his infiniteneſſe in all perfection; but alſo his goodneſſe and mercy towards them, then this flame of Gods loue kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth in their cold hearts the fire of loue towards God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which maketh them to thinke nothing too much or enough which they can doe or ſuffer for his ſake; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are moued to make an holy vſe of all they knowe, both for the auoyding of all which God hateth, whom they ſo loue, and the embracing and practiſing of all which he loueth and and requireth. But the knowledge of the vnregenerate is a light onely without hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e which driueth them further from God, and alienateth their hearts from him, becauſe they cannot apply to their owne vſe his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing attributes, but rather are terrified with his wiſedome, power and iuſtice, whereby he is able and willing to puniſh and take vengeance on all ſinners. Neither doeth it ſtirre them vp to any obedience, (vnleſſe it be for ſeruile feare) but rather enableth them to rebell and diſobey more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, whileſt by their great learning, their ſubtill ſhifts and nice deſtinctions, they can more cunningly vntwiſt the cords of Gods Commaundements which ſhould bind them to their dutie, and ſo winde themſelues and ſlip their neckes out of the yoke of Gods Lawe, that it cannot hold them, and whileſt thereby they are enabled to defend their ſins with their ſubtill ſophiſtry, and to preſerue themſelues from iuſt cenſures, their names from deſerued ſhame, &amp; to ſtoppe the crye of their conſciences, that they may not checke and accuſe them for their ſinnes. Finally the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the regenerate bringeth them to true humilitie, and the better and more clearely they conceiue of Gods goodneſſe, power and glorious maieſtie and of their owne miſery, ſins and imperfections, the more they abaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and become vile in their owne ſight, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who when he moſt neerely and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly conuerſed with God, had the meaneſt conceipt of

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:10733:149"/> all that will receiue them by the hand of faith, and will turne vnto God by vnfained repentance: vnto which truth of God reuealed in the miniſtery of the Word, the holy ſpirit by a ſecrete operation worketh an aſſent as being moſt infallible, ſeeing it proceedeth from him who is trueth it ſelfe and cannot lye, which aſſent being effectuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in our vnderſtandings a perſwaſirn that our ſinnes though many and haynous, are yet pardonable; and in our iudgements a moſt precious eſteeme of Gods mercies and Chriſts merits, from and by which alone we receiue remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In our hearts alſo this effectuall aſſent worketh an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and conſtant deſire that they may be pardoned, and to this ende an hungring and thirſting after Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe; in our willes a firme reſolution to reſt vpon Chriſt alone for iuſtification and ſaluation; and in our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a conſcionable endeauour in the vſe of all good meanes, whereby we may be more and more aſſured, that we ſhall haue our part in the mercies of God and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt. And theſe are the firſt degrees of iuſtifying faith which who ſo want are deſtitute of it; the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrought in vs, the Lord bleſſeth the meanes of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the beleeuer conſcionably vſeth with a deſire to profit by them, as the word, Sacraments, Prayer and the reſt, for the encreaſing of theſe firſt degrees in vs, vntil they growe from a graine of muſtardſeede to a great tree, from an aſſent to an apprehenſion and application of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with ſome aſſurance that Gods mercy and Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits belong vnto vs. Vnto which degree the moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who labour after it doe attaine, if death preuent them not and hinder them from comming from their ſpirituall infancy to their riper age in Chriſt. Now this faith being come to application of Chriſt and the promiſes, and ſome aſſurance that they belong to the beleeuer, it groweth daily in the carefull and diligent Chriſtian to more ſtrength, by his often feeling and experience of Gods loue, by his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him in his holy ordinances, by teſtifying and approuing of his loue towards God againe, in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall

To which I anſwere that they haue no true faith, but (as it were) in a dreame and dotage, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude themſelues by miſtaking their carnall and ſecure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption for a liuely and iuſtifying faith. But how ſhall
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:10733:150"/> we diſcerne the one from the other, ſeeing they ſeeme to haue oftentimes as ſtrong confidence &amp; aſſurance of their ſaluation as the beſt Chriſtians? I anſwere that though there be betweene them ſome ſeeming ſimilitude, yet there is as great difference as betweene pure gold &amp; a rotten poſt guilded ouer. For firſt true faith is grounded on the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures &amp; the word of God, but preſumption hath no ground but an idle conceipt ariſing cut of pride and ſelfe-loue; True faith alwayes followeth vnfained humiliation in the ſight and ſenſe of our ſinne and miſery; whereas the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous man was neuer humbled, but hath a proude conceipt of his owne righteouſneſſe and worthineſſe. Faith followeth illumination and knowledge, and firſt we muſt know God and his Chriſt, before we can truely beleeue in them; but preſumption riſeth commonly out of ignorance, and the more deſtitute the woldly man is of the knowledge of God and his wayes, the more bold and confident hee is in his perſwaſion. True faith is ioyned with all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as loue zeale of Gods glory, humilitie, patience and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, manifeſting it ſelfe by the fruites that it bringeth foorth in good workes. But preſumption is ſeuered from them all, and goeth alone without any ſuch company and attendants. True faith is not diſcerned before ſound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, and then it beginneth in ſome ſmall and weake de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; but preſumption is borne and bred with vs, and in an inſtant commeth to its full ſtrength; which maketh the ſecure worldling to bragge, that he hath alwayes beleeued, and is ſo ſtrong in faith, that he neuer doubted of his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. True faith is not attained vnto without great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it being no leſſe a worke to beleeue the Goſpell then to fulfill the Lawe; but preſumption voluntarily creepeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts, and the leſſe paines wee take in the vſe of Gods holy ordinances, the more eaſily it entreth, and the ſtronger it waxeth. Faith is alwayes aſſaulted with doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the one being a fruite of the ſpirit, the other of the fleſh, there is a great and continuall conflict betweene them; but preſumption is bold and confident, and he who
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:10733:150"/> is poſſeſſed of it, profeſſeth that hee neuer doubted of his ſaluation, neither feeleth he any conflict in him, becauſe he is wholly carnall, and corruption warreth not againſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but onely runneth out of one extreame into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for when the ſecure worldling being by ſome meanes awakened out of his lethargy ceaſeth to preſume, then he beginneth to deſpaire. Faith purifieth the heart and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by loue, and is neuer ſeuered from vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but preſumption nouriſheth and increaſeth all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full corruptions, and they who moſt preſume are moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of all true loue towards God and their neighbours. And howſoeuer they leaue ſome groſſe ſinnes forworldly reſpects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they repent of none, there being no charge in their affections, but onely in their actions; yea in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect alſo they nouriſh many ſins in their boſomes which they thinke moſt ſweete and aduantageable, and will by no meanes be perſwaded to part with them. Faith vniteth and applieth Chriſt vnto the beleeuer for all vſes for which God gaue him, that is as well for ſanctification as for iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and ſaluation, and applieth the vertue of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> blood, for the taking and purging away of the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and corruption of ſinne, as well as the guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and as it taketh hold of Chriſt to make him ours, ſo it giueth and offereth our ſoules and bodies vnto Chriſt, that we may become his, and be wholly deuoted and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his worſhip and ſeruice: but preſumption onely apprehendeth Chriſt for the remiſſion of ſinne and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of euerlaſting life, and not for the mortification of ſinne by vertue of his death, nor ſpirituall quickening and renewing by power of his reſurrection; and ſo alſo it is onely a receiuer but no giuer, it taketh all in ſhewe which Chriſt offereth, but it will in loue of thankefulneſſe returne nothing vnto him againe. Faith finding it owne weakenes, and the ſharpe encounters of doubting and incredulity, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth earneſtly in the vſe of all good meanes whereby it may bee more and more encreaſed and confirmed, as hearing the word, receiuing the Sacrament, reacing, prayer,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:10733:151"/> meditation and ſuch like; but preſumption finding no ſuch aſſaults, ſecurely neglecteth all theſe helpes, feeling it ſelfe then the ſtrongeſt when it is moſt deſtitute of them. Finally true faith endureth in the day of fiery tryall and temptation, and euen when God ſeemeth to frowne, to withdrawe outward teſtimonies of his loue, and in ſtead of them ſendeth afflictions and croſſes, then the beleeuer with Abraham, <hi>hopeth aboue hope, and beleeueth againſt beliefe,</hi> it <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 18. Iob. 13. 15. &amp; 19. 25.</note> pearceth through all theſe cloudes of diſcomfort with a liuely and ſpirituall eye, and beholdeth the face of alouing father in Chriſt, euen when hee ſtill holdeth the rodde in his hand; yea though it haue no ſenſible comfort, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent feeling of Gods fauour, yet being the <hi>ſubſiſtance of things hoped for, and the euidence of things not ſeene,</hi> it ſtill <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> maketh the beleeuer to flee vnto God, and to reſt vpon him alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for freedome from euill or fruition of good. But the preſumptuous man ſwelled with the winde of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence like a bladder, letteth out all with the pricke of a pin, and after all his Thraſonicall bragges of ſtrength and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, hee fainteth and cowardly yeeldeth when he is firſt encountred with croſſes and afflictions. His courage is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cooled, his confidence turned into diſtruſt his proude preſumption into affrighting terrours and helliſh deſpaire; and as it was chiefely grounded on outward things and worldly <hi>proſperitie,</hi> ſo when theſe are taken away, then it alſo quaileth, faileth and commeth to nothing.</p>

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:10733:151"/> and not onely in regard of puniſhment, and an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be vnburthened of it. But the temporarie is neuer thus throughly humbled, for whileſt he ſeeth ſome ſinnes he winketh at others, he grieueth and groneth, rather vnder the puniſhment, then vnder the ſinne; hee is willing to part with ſome ſinnes which rather pinch his conſcience then pleaſe his affection, but eſteemeth others no burthen, yea rather his chiefe delight; and though he leaueth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet he truely reputeth of none, becauſe there is onely a ſurceaſing of the action, but no change of the heart and affection.</p>

For true faith highly eſteemeth Chriſt, and preferreth him and his righteouſneſſe before all the world, counting all things in compariſon of them dung and loſſe; and therefore is ready to forſake all that it may inioy him: but temporarie faith <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 2: Phil. 3. 9.

Whence ariſe thoſe deſires in the heart, and reſolution in the will before ſpoken off, whereby the beleeuer hungreth after Chriſt and his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and caſteth himſelfe vpon him alone for iuſtification.

For the deſires of the true beleeuer is to be made partaker of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:10733:152"/> Chriſt and his benefits are exceeding feruent and earneſt, like the deſires of (<note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 14. 1.</note>) couetous men after riches, of (<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 30. 1</note>) <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> after children; of the (<note n="c" place="margin">Cant 2. 5.</note>) louing bride after her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued bridegroome, of the (<note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 143. 6.</note>) dry and chopped ground after pleaſant ſhowers, (<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 5. 6.</note>) of the hungry and thirſtie after meate and drinke; of the (<note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 20. 40.</note>) woman with childe after deſired meates, who ſo longeth that ſhe is ready to miſcarry and periſh, if her longing deſire be not ſatisfied: But the deſires of temporarie faith are faint and cold, and though they can be content to haue the things belonging to ſaluation, if they will come with eaſe and ſmall coſt, they chooſe rather to be without them, then that they ſhould be ouer charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or take vp too much of their time and labour.

But the faith of temporaries is eaſily attained without any great oppoſition or long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for no ſooner doth he heare the Word, but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he receiueth it with ioy, and as ſoone as the ſeede is caſt <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 20.</note> into the ſtonie ground, it forthwith ſpringeth and ſheweth it ſelfe in the greene blade of a glorious profeſſion. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth before it grieueth, and comfort commeth before mourning; It is exalted before there was any humiliation, and triumpheth in victorie without any conflict. And the reaſon is, becauſe the temporary beleeuer is not much croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his preſumptuous conceipt by Sathan or his owne fleſh, who are content to let him flatter himſelfe with a ſhaddow and ſemblance of faith which is without vſe or fruit, that reſting in this, he may neuer labour after ſuch a faith as is ſound and ſubſtantiall; knowing well enough, that it will nothing profit him, ſeeing within a while his inlightning will turne to greater darknes, his beleeuing to deſperate denying or deepe deſpairing, his waſhing and cleanſing, to greater pollution and defiling, and that hee may at pleaſure make his re-entrance with <hi>ſeuen ſpirits worſe then himſelfe and ſo make the laſt end of this man worſe</hi>

For he that aſſuredly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth Gods loue in Chriſt, maketh conſcience of all his workes and wayes, carefully doing thoſe things which may pleaſe him who hath ſo loued him, and whom hee ſo loueth, and flying thoſe things which may offend him. <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 5. &amp; 3 9.</note> Whereof it is that the Apoſtle ioyneth them together; <hi>The end</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the commandement is charitie, out of a pure</hi>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the faithfull man reioyceth in ſpirituall things, the aſſurance of Gods loue, the remiſsion of his ſinnes and his owne ſaluation: and though hee taketh ſome ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the things of this life, yet it is but ſmall in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the other.

And ſo likewiſe it is not commune to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to haue this ability, for there are many who haue a great meaſure of grace, ſight of ſinne, and ſenſe of wants,

And this I write not to detract any thing from the excellency of their guifts, who are able vpon all occaſions to expreſſe the deſires and prayers of their heart in good wordes and conuenient diſcourſe of ſpeach; ſeeing this is a guift of God, which not onely ſtirreth vp our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, but is profitable alſo for the edification of others, who can onely conceiue of holy deſires, as they are by vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance made knowne of thoſe that haue them; but partly to giue vnto the prayer of the heart and ſoule a ſuperiour excellency, farre aboue the prayer of the lippes, euen then alſo when it is without it; partly that none ſhould pleaſe themſelues in it, though they could rauiſh others with the admiration of their gifts, if they be not as earneſt, deuoute and feruent in the deſires of their hearts as they are able and eloquent in the prayers of their mouthes, for of theſe in their greateſt excellency, it may be truely ſaide, that they are in Gods eſtimate but meere lip-labour, which will for reward drawe vpon vs that iuſt cenſure, <hi>this people draweth neare vnto me with their lips, when their hearts are farre from</hi>

Of which this is an euident ſigne, when as wee haue libertie of ſpeach and

Of the ſixt effect of the ſpirit, which is repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and of the preparation there unto.</note> A ſixt effect of the ſpirit dwelling in vs is like vnto the former, namely vnfained repentance and amendment of life; vnto which it maketh the ſame preparation, that it doth for faith. For firſt by the miniſterie of the law, the ſpirit (as our Sauiour ſpeaketh) <hi>conuinceth vs of ſin,</hi> ſhewing vnto vs both the hainouſneſſe of our ſinnes, together with their multitude, and alſo the grieuous and endleſſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 8.</note> which they haue deſerued. And this it doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly at the firſt in a more generall and confuſed maner, amazing and aſtoniſhing vs with terrours and feares, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of minde, and panges of conſcience when as wee ſee the huge maſſe or mountaine of our manifold and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinnes, as it were in the whole lumpe; and the wrath of God, the curſe of the Law, the plagues and puniſhments of this life and the life to come, which we haue by them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly, and (in reſpect of our owne meanes) ineuitably drawne vpon vs; and afterwards more particularly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly it ſetteth our ſinnes in order before vs; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſenteth to our viewe thoſe ſinnes which wee are moſt guiltie off, and by which wee haue moſt diſhonoured God and wounded our owne conſciences By all which it worketh in vs that which we call penitence, contrition, and humiliation, whereby we are caſt downe vnder the heauie waight of our ſinnes and lye grieuing and groning vnder them; as it were vnder an intollerable burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, finding no reſt or comfort in our ſelues, or in any worldly things beſides.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:10733:159"/> And thus the ſpirit by the law (as it were) with an yron hammer, battereth and bruiſeth our hard and ſtony hearts in pieces, that he may mixe with them, beeing made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, <note place="margin">Ier. 4. 3.</note> the oyle of his ſpirituall graces; and vſeth it like a plow to breake vp (as it were) theſe clunge, ſtiffe, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low grounds, that being thus prepared he may ſow in them theſe holy ſeedes. For when hee hath thus caſt vs downe and throughly humbled vs, then he raiſeth vs vp againe, by reuealing vnto vs the myſterie of ſaluation, the mercies of God, and merits of Chriſt, offered vnto all who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them by ſaith. And then (as hath beene ſhewed) it worketh in vs an hungring deſire after Chriſt and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and a carefull, earneſt and conſtant endeauour in the vſe of all good meanes, as the hearing of the word, prayer, and the reſt, whereby wee may be made partakers of them. The which by his inward and ſecret operation, he ſo bleſſeth and ſanctifieth vnto vs, that they become ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to worke in vs a liuely faith, whereby wee lay hold vpon Chriſt and his benefits, and ſo are aſſured of the mercie of God and the remiſsion and pardon of all our ſinnes, of Gods grace in this life, and eternall glory in the life to come.</p>

All which wee
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:10733:159"/> doe not out of ſeruile feare, but out of child-like loue and affection, which maketh vs willing and deſirous by our new obedience to pleaſe and glorifie our heauenly father, not for feare of condemnation, but becauſe through the mercies of God, and merits of Chriſt, we are aſſured that we ſhall neuer be condemned. Where by the way we may note a notable difference betweene that ſorrow for ſinne which the ſpirit worketh in the regenerate, and that which is in carnall men: For though theſe may ſorrow and grieue after they haue ſinned, yet it is not for ſinne it ſelfe, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance whereof is pleaſant vnto them, but for the puniſhments, which they either preſently feele, or feare and expect in time to come: where as the ſorrow of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is a floud or ſtreame that ſpringeth from faith and loue, making vs to bewaile our ſinnes becauſe we haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and diſhonoured ſo good a God who hath freed vs from the guilt and puniſhment of them by giuing his onely Sonne to death as the price of our redemption.</p>

For as in nature corruption goeth before generation, the aboliſhing of the old forme, before the bringing in of the new; ſo before wee can bee ſpiritually renewed, the old man muſt bee killed and crucified, and then the new man will bee quickned and reuiued; ſinne and corruption is purged away, and then holineſſe and righteouſneſſe is wrought in vs. Firſt then in effecting this worke of repentance, the Spirit of God dwelling in vs, purgeth and purifyeth vs from all our ſinfull corruptions in all the parts of our ſoules and bodies, by applying vnto vs the efficacie and power of Chriſt Ieſus his death, which mortifith and crucifieth them in vs, ſo as they doe no longer raigne in our mortall bodies as in time paſt.

Now that we may not be thus deceiued, let vs remember, that hee who is led by the ſpirit, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſimple obedience vnto the law of God becauſe hee requireth it, but the vnregenerate in diſsimulation for worldly and ſiniſter reſpects hee yeeldeth totall obedience vnto the whole law of God, and with all the powers and faculties of his ſoule, and body; but the other onely in the outward man and that vnto ſome commandements alone, making no conſcience of the reſt. Hee is conſtant in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, becauſe the cauſe therof Gods loue towards him, and his loue towards God is conſtant and permanent; and he walketh daily &amp; continually in Gods law, as in his way; but the other is obedient by fits onely, going forward and backward, as he is ſpurred on, or curbed and rayned in, by worldly reſpects, which being mutable and vnconſtant doe make his obedience like vnto them. In which reſpect the motion of the vnregenerate in the waies of godlineſſe may be ſaid to be dead and accidentall, incited and ſtirred on by outward cauſes, as the horſe which would not goe vnleſſe he were compelled by the ſpurre, or like the wheeles in the clocke, which no longer moue then the waights and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes doe hang vpon it. But the motion of the regenerate is liuely and naturall, proceeding from an inward cauſe, euen the ſpirit of God dwelling in vs, which quickneth vs (as it were) with a new ſoule of life and power, whereby wee
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:10733:162"/> are inabled to goe on in the wayes of godlineſſe, euen as a man naturally moueth and walketh by vertue of his ſoule; <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> which quickeneth and ſtrengtheneth his body to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe actions. So that in a true Chriſtian there is the right perpetuall motion, whoſe cauſe is not outward, but in himſelfe, making him conſtantly and continually to goe on in his holy way, as kindely and naturally, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that godly nature whereof hee is made partaker by the holy ſpirit, euen as the fountaine ſprings and the riuer runnes. And how ſoeuer there may bee both in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and the vnregenerate an heate of loue and zeale which is the cauſe of all their motion and actions, yet there is great difference betweene them, for the one is like the heate in a bathe, whoſe cauſe is naturall and in it ſelfe, and is therefore conſtant and continuall, and not abated and leſſened but rather intended and increaſed by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cold of croſſes and afflictions; but the other like the heate of ordinarie hot water, which being naturally colde, and onely hot by accident and heate of the fire, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant but though for a time it may be much more hot then the other, yet the cauſe being not in it ſelfe, but outward and accidentall, when this is put out, the heate continueth not, but againe returneth to more then wonted coldneſſe. For ſo the heate in the vnregenerate being onely cauſed by outward proſperitie and temporall benefits, they ſeeme fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent in their loue towards God whileſt theſe continue, but if this fuell which nouriſheth it, be taken away, and they be compaſſed about with afflictions and perſecutions, they become more colde in their loue and zeale towards God then euer they were before. Or elſe they may be reſembled to a liuing body and dead carkaſe; the one whereof is hot by an inward cauſe, euen the radicall and vitall heate which warmeth the bloud in all the veines; but the other howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it may bee made hote by the heate of the fire and by much friction and rubbing, yet it continueth not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then theſe meanes are applyed, becauſe it hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſe, but they beeing remoued, it becommeth

The ſecond fruite of the ſpirit is vnfained loue of God, not onely for his benefits receiued or expected, preſent proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, the confluence of worldly benefits, and euerlaſting ſaluation; but alſo in his owne nature and in reſpect of his <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 7.</note> goodneſſe, mercy, iuſtice, holineſſe and all other his ſauing attributes.

And for the firſt this ſoberneſſe of minde maketh vs contented with that meaſure of earthly bleſsings which wee enioy, as being that portion which God hath allotted vnto vs; and not ſo much as to deſire any more, but when the Lord offereth it vnto vs by honeſt and lawfull meanes. Contrarie wherevnto are the deſires and indeauours of worldly men, who when they haue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, murmure and repine againſt Gods prouidence, and are ready vpon all occaſions to vſe vnlawfull meanes for the

For example though the vnregenerate may haue ſome illightning in ſpeculation, which at the firſt appearance may reſemble that ſauing, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and experimentall knowledge, which is in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet indeede there is (as hath beene ſhewed) many and great differences betweene them, and therefore that ſhew and ſemblance whereby for a time they deceiue themſelues and others, will in a while vaniſh, when as being ſeuered from all power of godlineſſe and fruits of obedience, it ſhalbe diſcouered to haue been in reſpect of the qualitie of it falſe and counterfait. Though they may ſeeme to haue a true and iuſtifying faith, becauſe they giue aſſent to the whole Word, and eſpecially to the gracious promiſes of the Goſpell, which cauſeth in them ſome temporarie ioy, yet being vneffectual, and neither working in their will any conſtant reſolution to imbrace Chriſt, and to be ready to forſake the world and earthly vanities, nor in their hearts any hungring and thirſting deſire after him and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe for their iuſtification, but onely as it may ſtand with their worldly deſignes and ends; it continueth not in the time of tentation, but either when they are allured with the baites of proſperitie, or preſſed and pinched with croſſes and perſecution, they fall away and become apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates from the faith. So though their mortification may ſeeme to reſemble, yea and ſometimes to goe before that which is ſincere and in truth, yet it is not generall and indefinite, but alwayes limited either to ſome few ſinnes, or all ſauing ſome few; and ſtill the hypocrite and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie beleeuer hath ſome darling and beloued ſinne which he nouriſheth in his boſome, and holdeth (like ſweete meates) vnder his tongue, as we ſee in <hi>Herod, Iudas, Demas,</hi>

So they may ſeeme to haue loſt the grace of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, when as they are ouertaken afreſh with their old ſinnes; and when their corruptions after they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a deadly wound, doe ſeeme to reuiue againe, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer ſome ſtrength, by exerciſing their vigour in their earthly members; eſpecially when as after they are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they relapſe and fall into the ſame groſſe ſinnes, not onely ignorantly and through infirmitie, but alſo witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and willingly againſt their owne knowledge and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

And yet all this while theſe ſauing graces are not loſt, but onely hid and couered; they are not outright killed, but onely brought into a deadly ſownde, the faculties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are not quite periſhed, but the functions and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them onely for a time are hindred and interrupted.</p>

So the Sunne ſhineth continually in his full brightneſſe, and yet it is often had from our eyes by the darke cloudes or opacous earth. The fire ſtill retaineth his natural heate, and may increaſe it ſelfe in combuſtible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when it is couered with aſhes, or is ſo pend in through the cloſeneſſe of the place, that it cannot for the preſent be ſeene or felt.

A childe which is growing doeth not in the fit of an ague looſe his growth, and howſoeuer the fleſh may be abated and ſtrength impaired, yet the radicall moyſture and heate being inwardly preſerued, well may his growth be a little while hindred, but when the ague is loſt and paſt, he grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth faſter then euer before. So the ſtreames that come from the fountaine may bee for a time ſtopped in their courſe, but in the very time of the ſtopping they are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and encreaſed, vntill at laſt they growe ſo ſtrong, that they beate downe that which hindreth their courſe, or riſe ſo high, that they ouerflow and runne ouer it. And that I may fit the ſimilitude to our preſent purpoſe, a worthy champion may be ſo tyred in the fight, that hee may haue no more ſtrength then a childe to performe any valorous enterpriſe; and yet the act and operation of his ſtrength is onely hindered for a time; and as for the habite it ſelfe it is not impaired, but much increaſed by this martiall exerciſe, and will alſo appeare more able for like emploiments after a litle reſt, and much more vigorous and ſtrong euen in reſpect of act and operation. And thus it is with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in this ſpirituall conflict; their outward foyles doe not

Gods graces in them increaſe in the fountaine when they are ſtopped from running in the ſtreame; and when this holy fire is kept by ſome outward obſtacle and (as it were) the Antiperiſtaſis of ſinnefull corruption, ſo as it cannot flame out, nor extend the heate farre of, then doeth it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe inwardly, and when it burſteth out doeth burne with greater heate then it did before, when it had full liberty, and was not curbed in with any outward vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>

In which eſtate there can be to them nothing but horrour and vexation of ſpirit; and out of which they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer but with great difficultie and appearance of danger.

It is the roote of all ſinne, and the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and fountaine of all other wickedneſſe, from which idolatry, blaſphemy, murther, adultry and all impietie and vnrighteouſneſſe growe and ſpring. Conſequently it is ſuch an enemy as maketh God himſelfe our enemy, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vs to the hot flames of his fiery wrath, and would innumerable times caſt vs headlong into the euerlaſting torments of hell fire, if the infinite mercies of God did not ſtay vs in the way. It is the prouoker and inticer to all wickedneſſe, and all the outrages and horrible crimes which are committed in the world, may challenge the fleſh as their chiefe cauſe and authour. From it came <hi>Caines</hi> murther, <hi>Lots</hi> inceſt, <hi>Dauids</hi> adultry, the malice of the Iewes and Prieſtes which moued them to ſlander, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, accuſe, condemne, whip, crowne with thornes, and crucifie the Lord of life. It was it that pearced our Sauiours hands and feete, that thruſt the ſpeare into his ſide, that made him to bee in that agony and perplexity in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and vpon the croſſe, and which moueth men daily to crucifie him afreſh, and to trample his precious blood vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their filthy feete, as though it were an vnholy thing; and can wee finde in our hearts to haue any peace or truce with ſuch a malitious enemy to our bleſſed Sauiour? And ſhall wee not rather with implacable anger and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reſolution aſſault, perſue, wound and kill it which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred all theſe indignities to our deareſt Lord? Moreouer as it is the cauſe of all ſinne, ſo alſo of all puniſhment in this life, of all our miſeries, of ſickneſſe and diſeaſes of the body, trouble of conſcience, and terrours of minde, of pouertie and penury in eſtate, loſſe of our good names, ſhame and reproach, and all other the deſerued puniſhments of ſinne, and for concluſion of all, of death in the ende of our liues and of euerlaſting condemnation and deſtruction in the world to come. For if <hi>we liue after the fleſh wee ſhall dye,</hi> the

For the former, the battaile is to be maintained againſt the fleſh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the weapons of our warfare muſt not be carnall, ſeeing they will rather ſtrengthen and cheriſh, then wound and mortifie fleſhly corruptions, but they muſt bee ſpirituall, euen that whole armour of God deſcribed by the Apoſtle in the ſixth chapter to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> For as the Apoſtle telleth vs, <hi>though we walke in the fleſh, yet wee doe not warre after the fleſh; for the weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but mighty through God, to the pulling downe of ſtrong holds, caſting down the imaginations, and euery high thing which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth it ſelfe againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into</hi>

Onely let me perſwade euery Chriſtian that is willing and deſirous to get the victory in this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian warfare, that they doe with all diligence put it on, not onely by peece-meale; for ſpirituall death, as well as corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, can make entrance by one place vnarmed and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, as if the whole armour were left off, but we muſt be armed at all points, that all being couered none may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daungered. Otherwiſe we ſhall neuer be able to maintaine this fight with any true valour or hope of victory. For
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:10733:182"/> howſoeuer a ſouldiar may bee euen vnarmed and without weapons foole-hardy and deſperate, yet hee can neuer bee truely valourous, and though hee may bee raſh in making attempts and ruſhing into the fight yet can hee not being vnarmed and receiuing one wound after another, be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly conſtant in holding out vnto the ende of the conflict, but is fitter by reaſon of his lightneſſe to runne away, then to maintaine ſuch a fight as yeeldeth vnto him no hope of victory. And in the ſecond place let vs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade euery one who fighteth in this Warfare, that they doe not truſt in their owne ſtrength, but in the power of Gods might, nor in their ſpirituall armour and weapons which in themſelues are farre too weake to beare off the canon-ſhot of our mighty enemies, but in the promiſes of God which aſſure vs of victory, and in his gracious aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which we are daily to craue by feruent prayer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and by nothing elſe wee ſhall be enabled to obtaine the victory. </p>

                  </note> The rules of direction which are to be obſerued and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed of thoſe who deſire to get the victory in this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conflict are of two ſorts: For eyther they tend to the weakening and ſubduing of the fleſh, or to the nouriſhing and ſtrengthning of the ſpirit. The former alſo are of two kindes. The firſt is that we withdraw and withhold from the fleſh all meanes whereby it may gather ſtrength; the ſecond that wee vſe the contrary meanes whereby it may be weakened and diſabled. Concerning the former: it is the care of all men that are to fight againſt mighty enemies, to deale with them as the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> firſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſearching where their chiefe ſtrength lyeth and wherein it conſiſteth, and then in the next place vſing all meanes to diſable and depriue them of it; whereby the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory becommeth more eaſie and aſſured, and leſſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and diſaduantageable to the conquerours. The which courſe muſt be held alſo by vs in this combat with the fleſh, if we deſire to ouercome To which purpoſe let vs obſerue theſe three rules. The firſt is, that wee doe not nouriſh and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:10733:183"/> ſtrengthen the enemy which wee deſire to ouercome. As for example wee muſt not feede our fleſh with ſinfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and carnall delights, nor giue it eaſe and contentment by ſatisfying and glutting it with all worldly ſuperfluities; we muſt not cocker and pamper it with eaſe and delicacy, with gluttony and drunkennes, with vnlawfull ſports or immoderate vſe of honeſt recreations, with chambering and wantonneſſe, merry meetings and the voluptuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of worldly men. For though this might go for good policy betweene nation and nation, to helpe forward their enemy in their voluptuous delights, becauſe hereby they are weakened and made effeminate; yet it is not ſo in this conflict with the fleſh, ſeeing the more it is effeminated and pampered with carnall delights, the more it is ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened againſt the ſpirit. Now what folly is it to victuall a mighty enemy which warreth againſt vs, and to put wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons into their hands whereby they may kill or put vs to flight? The which notwithſtanding is dayly committed by innumerable Chriſtians, who profeſſe themſelues ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the fleſh, and yet in the meane time giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ouer to all voluptuous courſes, and take more care to ſatisfie the luſts of the fleſh, and to nouriſh and ſtrengthen it with worldly delicacies, then euer they did for the ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the ſpirit, that it might obtaine the victory againſt our ſpirituall enemies. And as wee are not to nouriſh the fleſh by miniſtring foode vnto it, ſo are we not to leaue it to it owne liberty, and to make free prouiſion for it ſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtraint; which if we doe, it will neede no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigher to prouide victuals enough, for the ſatisfying of our carnall luſts.

He therefore who would withſtand the fleſh tempting him to idolatry, muſt auoide the meanes and occaſions which bring vnto it, as wil-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſuperſtition making of images for religious vſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and alliance with idolaters; for though hee were as wiſe as <hi>Salomon</hi> himſelfe, yet if he auoide not theſe meanes and occaſions he will be ouertaken with this ſinne.

For if <hi>Dauid</hi> giuing himſelfe to eaſe and ſloth and ſuffering his eyes to gaze on ſtrange beauty, was ouer taken and foyled by his ſinfull fleſh, how ſhall wee ſtand and get the victory ouer our fleſhly luſtes, if we giue them the aduantage of meanes and opportunitie? Thus he who would not hearken vnto

In a word if wee would reſiſt the fleſh tempting vs vnto any ſinne, let vs not entertaine the meanes and occaſions of them, when it offereth them vnto vs. But principally let vs auoide the ſocietie and company of wicked men, which are the diuels brokers, and the fleſhes bawdes to ſollicite vs vnto all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.

That if we doe not hate ſmall ſins as well as great, we hate none with chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian hatred.</note> Finally let vs conſider that if we doe not hate all ſinnes, ſmall and great, we doe not hate any with chriſtian hatred, for they that abhorre ſinne truely and ſpiritually, doe it on theſe grounds; firſt becauſe it hath the diuels ſtampe and ſuperſcription vpon it, who is Gods and our greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and his image &amp; title is on all his coine, vpon his peny as well as his ſhilling, his ſmalleſt ſinnes as wel as on thoſe which are of a larger ſize. And therefore with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that hate ſinne as ſinne, and the diuels preſſe money which he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to his ſeruants &amp; ſoldiers, his leaſt comes are no more current then the greateſt but all are cried downe and reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as baſe and of no value, both for the mettall and alſo the maiſters ſake. Secondly, they who purſue ſinne with a Chriſtian hatred doe therefore hate it, becauſe they loue and feare God, and would not doe any thing which
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:10733:203"/> might diſpleaſe him, therefore they abhorre and deteſt it becauſe it is ſo odious and abhominable in his ſight, and ſo oppoſite to his lawe and contrary to his nature. Now they who truely hate any ſinne vpon theſe grounds, they will hate euery ſinne, and in all degrees according to this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and portion, as it is more or leſſe odious in the ſight of God; and though they doe not equally hate all, becauſe there is an inequalitie amongſt them, yet are they not in loue with any, nor can finde in their hearts to giue the leaſt ſinnes willing entertainement. And therefore thoſe who abſtaine from hainous crimes, and make no conſcience of liuing in ſuch ſinnes as they eſteeme but ſmall, they doe it not out of their loue and filiall feare of God, which would make ſinnes of all ſorts odious vnto them, but either for feare of worldly ſhame or puniſhment, or out of a ſeruile feare of Gods iudgements, hell and condemnation, or that they may more quietly ſleepe in their carnal ſecurity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble of minde or torment of conſcience, which they could not quietly doe, if they were awakened and terrified with the guilt of hainous ſinnes and outragious crimes.</p>

Conc. 2.</note> And therefore I ſhall be the more briefe in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, howſoeuer I thinke it fit that ſomething ſhould bee added. And firſt wee will conſider this point negatiuely, ſhewing that all meanes are to bee ſhunned whereby the ſpirit is weakened and quenched, and then affirmatiuely, ſhewing that wee are to vſe all the meanes whereby it may be cheared and ſtrengthened. Concerning the former. The chiefe meanes whereby the ſpirit is weakened and quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched are our ſinnes, which doe vexe and grieue the good ſpirit of God dwelling in vs, and make him weary of his lodging and habitation. For no ſtinking filth can bee ſo noyſome vnto vs as ſinne is vnto this holy gueſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot indure to continue in our bodies and ſoules as his temples, if they be profaned and defiled with it. But aboue other ſins we weaken the ſpirit with ſins commited againſt knowledge and conſcience, wilfully, and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly; for ſuch ſinnes doe moſt oppoſitely croſſe and thwart the good motions of it, and doe as plainely contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it, as if they ſhould ſay in plaine tearmes though wee take notice of thy will, wee will not doe it but the cleane contrary. With which kinde of obſtinate rebellion the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis ſo wearied and tired, that it will no longer contend with vs to bring vs vnto goodneſſe, but will leaue vs to our owne vile luſtes, and a reprobate minde to goe on in ſinne with greedineſſe to our perdition. So the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that when the olde world reſiſted the motions of his ſpirit in the preaching of iuſt <hi>Noah,</hi> it ſhould no longer <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 3.</note> contend with them, but ſeeing this pure water of his ſpirit, would not quench their fiery luſts, he would quench them by
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:10733:206"/> other meanes, euen the vniuerſall flood which drowned the whole earth. Thus he complaineth, that <hi>hee was preſſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Amos. 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>their ſinnes as a cart is preſſed that is full of ſheaues,</hi> and therefore threatneth that hee will preſſe them downe with his heauy iudgements. And thus becauſe the Gentiles ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the common gift and illumination of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſo againſt knowledge and conſcience, therefore <hi>the Lord gaue them vp to their owne vile affections and to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>minde, to commit with greedineſſe all manner of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wickedneſſe.</hi> And therefore if wee would not haue the ſpirit to be ſo weakened and wearied, that it will leaue, and forſake vs; wee muſt not (as the Apoſtle exhorteth vs) <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 19.</note> quench it, and the good motions thereof by continuing in thoſe ſinnes from which it diſſwadeth vs; nor by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his lodging loathſome with the noyſome filth of ſin, <hi>grieue the good ſpirit of God, whereby wee are ſealed vnto the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>day of redemption.</hi> To which ende let vs conſider, that if we giue good entertainment to this holy gueſt, he wil ſup with vs and with his company make all our cheare comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yea rather he will feaſt vs, and make vs a moſt pleaſant banquet of all ſpirituall delicacies; he will beare part with vs in all our griefes; and as the Prophet ſpeaketh, he will by ſympathy and compaſſion <hi>be afflicted in our afflictions.</hi> Yea he will comfort vs in all our ſorrowes, and therefore let vs <note place="margin">Eſa. 63. 9.</note> take heede of vexing him; for if grieuing our comforter wee make him to leaue vs, who ſhall cheare and refreſh vs in all our miſeries?</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> moſt weakened.</note> But howſoeuer all ſinnes generally wound and weaken the ſpirit, yet there are ſome ſpeciall ſinnes aboue the reſt which doe infeeble it, and quench all the good motions of it; the firſt wherof is ignorance and blindnes of minde, the which pulleth (as it were) out of the hand of the ſpirit his chiefe weapon the two edged ſword of Gods Word whereby it defendeth it ſelfe, and offendeth his ſpirituall enemies, and like a blacke foggie miſt dazeleth and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the eyes of the vnderſtanding, ſo as it cannot diſcerne
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:10733:207"/> the ſleights and ſubtilties, the wiles and ſtrong deluſions of our ſpirituall enemies, nor on which ſide they ſtrike vs, nor how to ward off their blowes, nor withſtand the malice and fury of their tentations. The ſecond is infidelitie which diſableth the Spirit, whileſt it depriueth it of the chiefe comforts and encouragements whereby it is ſtrengthened againſt the aſſaults of the fleſh, namely Gods ſweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of grace in this life and glory in the life to come, to all thoſe who walk in the ſpirit, and mortifie the fleſh with the luſts thereof. Yea it weakeneth and looſeneth the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bond of our vnion with Chriſt, which is our faith, by which alone he is applyed, and ſo ſtoppeth and hindreth the influences of his graces, and the vertue and vigour, the iuice and ſap which from this roote of Ieſſe is deriued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, by which alone we are ſtrengthened againſt the fleſh and enabled to withſtand all the aſſaults of our ſpirituall enemies. The third is impenitencie the which is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to the health and vigour of the ſpirit, for beſides that it hindereth all the operations of our faith, the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt and all the promiſes made in him, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and ſweet fellowſhip with God, hiding from our ſight his fatherly countenance and the bright beames of his fauourable countenance, in the apprehenſion whereof the life of our life conſiſteth, and depriueth vs of the peace of conſcience and ioy in the holy Ghoſt, by which wee are in the ſpirituall man made ſtrong and couragious in the day of tentation; after that wee haue receiued wounds of the fleſh in the ſpirituall fight, it hindreth their cure, and cauſeth them to feſter and ranckle, and to growe euery day more dangerous and incurable then other. And after wee haue beene allured to drinke the ſweet poiſons of the fleſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching cup, this impanitencie doth cauſe vs to retayne them in the ſtomacke, vntill working they doe make vs ſicke vnto death, where as they would not be hurtfull and pernicious, if as ſoone as they were ſwallowed, they vvere caſt vp againe by vnfained repentance. The fourth ſin that
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:10733:207"/> weakeneth the ſpirit is carnall ſecurity and hardnes of heart, whereby wee bleſſe our ſelues when our eſtate is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and haue no ſenſe and feeling, neither of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and loue, nor of his anger and diſpleaſure, by the one whereof the ſpirit is ſtrengthened vnto Gods ſeruice, and by the other preſerued from ſinning againſt him. So alſo the ſtrength of the ſpirit is by this carnall ſecuritie much impayred, becauſe it maketh vs to put the euill day far from vs, and vtterly to neglect our ſpirituall enemies as though we had a ſecure peace and all cauſe of danger were farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued; it cauſeth vs to neglect our Chriſtian watch, and ſo to lye open to the malicious and ſecret aſſaults of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemies, and to neglect the meanes of our ſafety and defence, our ſpirituall foode and prouiſion, our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and munition, our fortifications and all other prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which ſhould be any meanes of defence in the day of battell; whereby the ſpiritual part is betrayed &amp; ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurprized before it expecteth any danger. The laſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſin wherby the ſpirit is weakened and all the good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof quenched, is the loue of the world, which like birdlime ſo beſmeareth the ſpirituall part and the wings of the ſoule, that it cannot flee aloft, but is intangled and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, fixed and faſtened to the earth and worldly vanities. More eſpecially the loue of honours and the glory of the world, doth make the ſpirituall man ſlacke and ſluggiſh in the purſuite of eternall glory and heauenly happineſſe. The loue of riches hindreth him from ſeeking with all earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſpirituall graces, and thoſe incomparable treaſures which are laide vp for vs in Gods Kingdome; it choaketh the ſeede of the Word, ſo as it cannot take roote and beare fruit, &amp; fruſtrateth all the good motions of the ſpirit, ſo as they cannot take effect, it expoſeth vs to many tentations and ſnares, and cauſeth vs to fall into many fooliſh &amp; hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full luſts, which drowne men in deſtruction and perdition. And ſo alſo the loue of earthly pleaſures doth much enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 9. 10</note> the ſpirituall part in the purſuit of thoſe eternall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and fulneſſe of ioy which are at Gods right hand for
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:10733:208"/> euermore; and as they weaken the body and effeminate the minde, ſo as they are made vnfit, euen for any warlike imployments in the world, ſo much more doe they diſable the ſoule and ſpirit for this warfare againſt the enemies of our ſaluation. For when the fleſh is pampered with theſe carnall delights, the ſoule is ſtarued and pined: when it is diſtended and growne fat &amp; groſſe with gluttony and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-cheare, the ſpirit is made leane and infeebled; when it reuelleth in fleſhly ioy, the regenerate part droopeth and mourneth, beeing ſpoyled and robbed of the ioyes of the holy Ghoſt. When it is filled and euen glutted with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, the ſpirit is ſtraitened of roome and hath no place where it may reſide: and therefore the Apoſtle requireth firſt emptineſſe of wine, and then that wee ſhould be filled <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 18.</note> with the ſpirit, to note vnto vs that fulneſſe of both will not ſtand together.</p>

Yea our care muſt bee not onely to ſtrengthen our faith in this aſſurance, that God who hath choſen vs will neuer leaue vs, and that hauing begun the good worke of regeneration, he will neuer giue it ouer, till he hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finiſhed it, becauſe hee is vnchangeable in his loue, and his gifts and calling are without repentance; but if wee would haue the ſpirit ſtrong and vigorous, wee moſt not neglect the feelings of faith, nor the ſenſible comforts of Gods loue, warming and comforting our hearts, but wee
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:10733:213"/> muſt labour to finde the vertue and efficacy of his grace working in vs, and haue the experimentall apprehenſion of the comforts of his ſpirit. Wee muſt endeauour to haue not onely Gods graces habitually, but to feele their ſeuerall actions and operations working our hearts to all good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For though the ſunſhine of Gods fauour, once ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon vs, can neuer vtterly faile, yet the beames thereof may by the interpoſition of our ſins bee ecclypſed from vs for a time; though the fountaine of his grace towards vs can neuer be dried vp, yet the ſtreames thereof may bee ſo ſtopped that wee can by preſent apprehenſion feele little comfort by it. And though our faith which is the life of our ſpirit, cannot be loſt of thoſe who euer had it, yet when the life of our life, the comfortable ſeelings of faith, our communion with God, peace of conſcience &amp; ioy in the holy Ghoſt, are taken away, or for a time ſuſpended and hid from vs, we are exceedingly weakened in the ſpirituall part, and haue litle comfort or courage in maintaining the fight againſt our ſpirituall enemies. Now theſe feelings of faith and comforts of the ſpirit are beſt obtained and kept, when as wee preſerue our Communion, fellowſhip and familiar acquaintance with God in the conſcionable and frequent vſe of his holy ordinances, the hearing of his word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prayer, the vſe of the Sacraments, keeping company with him in his holy aſſemblies, where he is preſent by his ſpirit; when as with the ſpouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> we reioice in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany and with <hi>Dauid</hi> bee rauiſhed with ioy and delight when as wee meete him in his holy Temple; and when as with them <note place="margin">Pſal. 84. 1. pſal. 42. 1. 2.</note> wee mourne and grieue for his abſence, and when he with draweth himſelfe doe ſeeke his face and fauour, and aboue all things deſire and long after his comfortable preſence. When as wee labour daily in the mortification of our ſins, which doe make a ſeperation betweene our God and vs, and doe exerciſe our ſelues in all holy duties of his ſeruice, thereby glorifying his holy name, and edifying our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by our good example. Which if wee doe, then ſhall the beames of Gods fauour, and the ſtreames of his graces,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:10733:213"/> haue a cleare paſſage vnto vs, with which our ſpirituall part ſhall be ſo cheared, cheriſhed and encreaſed in ſtrength, that we ſhall eaſily withſtand all the malice and fury of our ſpirituall enemies, and obtaine an happy victory in our Chriſtian warfare.</p>

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:10733:214"/> whole body is much ſtrengthened and increaſed by action and exerciſe, and decaieth and is greatly enfeebled by ſloth and idleneſſe. And thus it is alſo with the ſpirit and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all graces, let vs vſe them and we ſhall haue them; let theſe rootes of holineſſe bring forth their boughes and branches, their leaues of profeſſion and their fruits of practiſe, and they will liue and proſper, ſpread inwardly and ſpring and ſproute outwardly, but if wee hinder them from bearing their leaues and rootes, and bee ſtill cutting and lopping of their boughes and branches, they will in a while dye and periſh. Let this fire of the ſpirit haue fit vent to ſend out its flames of holy and righteous actions, and it will ſtill liue, burne and blaze, but if once wee beginne to ſtop this vent, it will preſently dye and turne to cold embers. Let faith exerciſe it ſelfe in apprehending the promiſes, in waiting for the performance, in fighting againſt doubting, and in bearing the fruits of good workes, and from a graine of muſtardſeede it will growe to a great tree, from ſmoking flaxe to a burning flame, and from a feeble aſſent to a firme and full perſwaſion. So let loue be exerciſed in doing and ſuffring for Gods ſake, in performing vnto him all holy ſeruice and Chriſtian duties; and in the workes of mercy and charitie towards our neighbours, and of a litle ſparke it will increaſe to a great fire, let the ſhoulders of patience be inured to bearing of the Croſſe, and ſuffering afflictions, in putting vp wrongs and ouercomming euill with good, though they bee weake and tender at the firſt, they will in a litle while become hard &amp; ſtrong, and ſo it is in all other graces, by exerciſe they are increaſed, by ſloth and eaſe they are weakned and waſted.
